* The Mall, which is located at the heart of Shimla, is a place where people visit to spend some quite time, free from the fear of being run over by vehicles, and has a typical personality of its own. The Mall bears the symbol of quintessential spirit of the colonial city. The heights of the shops along the mall are uniformly double storey, with gabled roofs in wooden frame construction. This style of architecture imparts a rhythmic and harmonic character, which is punctuated by melange of palpable crowds.
