#H/HP 
## Himachal Pradesh Social Stratification
### Good Track record
* Himachal Pradesh stands apart from many states in India with its strong track record of poverty reduction, service delivery, and human and social development outcomes, sanitation and is the first state in northern India that is close to being “open defecation free”.
#### Why HP have good HDI
* While Himachal Pradesh’s “special category” status allowed for fiscal space to spend on the social sectors, the foundation for progress was laid by land reforms that were first introduced in the 1950s and deepened later in the 1970s. 
* These reforms have meant that almost 80 percent of rural households in the state possess some land. Crucially, distribution of land across social groups is more equal in Himachal Pradesh compared to the rest of India. 
 * For instance, SCs who are historically overrepresented among the landless across India tend to own land in Himachal Pradesh, with the differential between them and other groups, in terms of average landholding size, converging over time.
* Great social change was witnessed with the abolition of untouchability. 
### Poverty Reduction in Himachal Pradesh
* Between 1993–94 and 2011, there was a 4x fourfold drop in poverty in the state. 
* Rural poverty, where 90 percent of its population lives, declined from 36.8 percent to 8.5 percent.
* life expectancy is 3.4 years longer than an average Indian expects to live; 
* and, per capita income is the second highest in India. 

## Education achievement in Himachal Prdesh
* Environment consciousness
* but lacks in employable skills hence mostly dependent on farming and government jobs 

## Women valued but neglected

### Status of women relatively better
Sons are desired for economic and socio*cultural reasons whereas daughters are valued for utilitarian and psychological reasons. 
 * Malnutrition among women and the girl child are rampant — even the well off are quite often pale and anaemic and these conditions are not accorded the status of major ailments.
 * Fasting weekly and special occasion
 * Family needs such as ‘collection of fuel, fodder and water; animal care; child care; cooking; washing clothes; cleaning utensils as well as the cowshed etc.’ fall in the exclusive domain of the daily workload of women — and from which they never get a respite.
* One major consideration is that Himachali women have a high involvement in work outside the home. 
* This contributes to their economic independence, freedom of movement, decision making power, and social recognition. 
* Women’s autonomy has been reinforced by local kinship practices (involving, for instance, enduring links between parents and married daughters), and by high rates of male out*migration. 

### Women labour force participation in HP
* In 2011–12, about 63 percent of rural women in the state reported themselves as being employed. 
 * This places Himachal Pradesh second in female labor force participation in the country, after Sikkim, and significantly above the all*India average of 27 percent. 
 * However, female labor force participation in urban areas was much lower, at 28 percent in 2011, but nonetheless much higher than other north Indian states and on par with states like Kerala and Tamil Nadu.
### Women problem in HP
* A significant characteristic is the absence of the pernicious ‘purdah’ system in most parts of the State.
* Patriarchal relations here leave more scope for female independence. 

## Response to Government schemes or Responsive/Active Citizen 
* When combined with a strong tribal ethos, diverse marriage patterns and the accompanying autonomy for women, it has been easier for Himachal Pradesh to enlist women’s participation in programs such as sanitation, immunization, and other health*related campaigns than it has been for neighboring states. 
* Finally, women in Himachal Pradesh have a strong tradition of protest movements against 
 * environmental degradation and male alcoholism.

## Backward Classes
* The Govt for the first time formulated a Special Component Plan (SCP) in 1979*80 now renamed as Scheduled Caste Sub Plan (SCSP) for the Scheduled Castes as part of the State Plan. 
 * The Scheduled Caste Sub Plan is specifically designed to channelize the flow of benefits and outlays
### Schedule cast spatial distribution
* Urbanization among the Scheduled Castes population is 6.60% as against the State average of 9.80%. 
* The Scheduled Castes in this State are not concentrated into specific regions but are widely dispersed and would be benefited equally as rest of the population. 
 * Plan is not area based as in case of Scheduled Tribes Sub Plan
* The district of Bilaspur, Kullu, Mandi, Solan, Shimla and Sirmour are the predominantly Scheduled Castes populated districts where Scheduled Castes concentration is above the State average.
* at 25 percent, and second only to Punjab. 
 * However, unlike other states, SCs in Himachal Pradesh, for the most part, own land, and have benefitted from the rapid decline in poverty.
