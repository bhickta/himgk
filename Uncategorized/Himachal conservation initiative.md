### CM inaugurates Swarnim Vatikas programme of Forest department:
-   50 glorious years of full statehood of Himachal Pradesh, Chief Minister Jai Ram Thakur planted a Cherry Blossom, commonly known as Pajja at Kareru Forest near Shimla and inaugurated the year long celebrations by the Forest Department to establish the Swarnim Vatikas at different places in the State.
-   This would create aesthetic spots nearby the habitation for people to relax, enjoy and get them educated regarding significance of nature and its conservation.
-   Sensitize and educate the people of the urban and semi urban community about the importance of forests and its conservation by involving them in the plantation activities.

### Himalayan water sharing ' kul system' endangered

Modern practices are threatening to break up an unusual water*tapping and water*sharing process in Himachal Pradesh. Devised hundreds of years ago, it converted barren land in Spiti into fertile fields.The Spiti area of Himachal Pradesh is a cold desert, but surprisingly, agriculture is its mainstay. Transforming Spiti's lunar*like terrain into an agrarian success story was made possible by an ingenious system devised centuries ago to tap distant glaciers for water. But short*sighted developmental policies, though well*intentioned, now threaten both this unique irrigation system and the social consciousness that spawned it.

For instance Spiti is an important trading post on the route connecting Ladakh and the plains of Himachal Pradesh. Villages in the Spiti sub*division are located between 3,000 m and 4,000 m, which means they are snowbound for six months in the year. Rainfall is negligible in Spiti because it is a rain*shadow area. The soil is dry and lacks organic matter. But, despite these handicaps, the Spiti valley has been made habitable and productive by human ingenuity.

The cropping season in is between May and October. Wheat and black peas are grown on black soil, green peas on sandy soil and black peas and barley on yellowish soil. A remarkable feature of farming in Spiti is the meticulous utilisation of every available space, however small. Even the boundaries of fields and the edges of pathways are used to grow fodder grasses. Fertilisation in winter is done with human waste collected in a novel way: Spiti's houses are double*storeyed and each is equipped with a dry latrine on the top floor and the waste is collected in a room below.

But Spiti's unique contribution to farming is kul irrigation, which utilises kuls (channels) to carry water from glacier to village. The kuls often span long distances, running down precipitous mountain slopes and across crags and crevices. Some kuls are 10 km long and have existed for centuries.
How kuls work The crucial portion of a kul is its head at the glacier, which is to be tapped. The head must be kept free of debris and so the kul is lined with stone to prevent clogging and seepage. In the village, the kul leads to a circular tank from which the flow of water can be regulated. For example, when there is need to irrigate, water is let out of the tank in a trickle. Water from the kul is collected through the night and released into the exit channel in the morning. By evening, the tank is practically empty, and the exit is closed. This cycle is repeated daily.

The kul system succeeds because Spiti residents cooperate and share. The culture also is instrumental in maintaining the carrying capacity of the surrounding cultivable land. However, this system, carefully nurtured through the centuries now runs the risk of being upset by government intervention.

Because of the limited water availability, inheritance laws in Spiti traditionally seek to prevent fragmentation of landholdings. The eldest son inherits not only the land, but also the farm implements, the family house and the family's water rights. His siblings either serve in the common household or, more likely, become monks or nuns in Buddhist monasteries. Thus, a sort of population control has been evolved, which serves to stave off pressure on the landholdings.

Water rights are owned exclusively by members of the bada ghars (big houses), who are descendants of the original settlers or founders of the village. This system, besides establishing the pre*eminence of the bada ghars, has also installed a local social hierarchy with the bada ghars on top. The greater the share of a family's water rights, the more land it controls. In Kaza, for example, water rights over the single kul irrigating 32 ha are shared by 18 bada ghars. Other families in Kaza have to buy water from the bada ghars, and payment is generally made in kind or providing labour, but often the water is given freely. Water transactions are based on trust and are neither written down nor codified.

When a good snowfall assures abundant water, kul water is freely dispensed, but when water is scarce, equality gives way to a preferential system. During a water shortage, bada ghar members irrigate their fields first; others get water only later in the season. This practice has the advantage of ensuring that the labour demand is spread over the entire harvest season, because the bada ghars' crops ripen early, when other families are free to help in harvesting. This spacing*out of labour does away with demand peaking at the same time throughout the valley and provides a firm basis for community labour. These cooperative efforts also mean that time and effort do not become areas of conflict between those who require labour and those offering it.

In Kibber, water is supplied by three kuls whose shares are owned jointly by 32 bada ghars. The kuls, named Phil, Phizur and Shrik, together irrigate 73 ha of land. Eighteen bada ghars use the waters of the Phil kul, whose supply is sufficient to irrigate 4 ha daily. The 18 families using it are divided into two groups of nine families each, and the water supply is alternated between the two groups on a daily basis. Water from Shrik, the smallest of the three kuls, is shared by six bada ghars, also divided into two groups. But the eight bada ghars that share the Phizur kul, are divided into four groups, with each getting water just once every four days because the kul's capacity is limited. Other families in Kibber have to acquire water from the 32 bada ghars.

Water shares are renewed and adjusted every season according to need, but a share cannot be lent, sold or disposed of in perpetuity. This restriction preserves the position of the bada ghar families.

Government Role :

Over the past 15 years, however, the Union government has slowly made its presence felt in the Spiti valley as a modernising agent whose actions are profoundly changing traditional production practices and social patterns. Its sponsorship of facilities ranging from schools to hospitals has opened up a variety of government jobs and agriculture is no longer the valley's only source of sustenance and employment.

The irrigation department has taken control of the kuls and introduced a number of technical and physical innovations. Kul heads, for example, have been reinforced with cement or concrete and some of the kuls have been complemented with rubber pipe. Old kuls are repaired and renovated in this manner and new kuls have been constructed.

These interventions, along with the increasing dominance of a market economy, a rise in labour mobility and the availability of alternative sources of employment, have doomed traditional social mechanisms for the repair and maintenance of kuls. Traditionally, community labour was used to repair kuls and each household contributed either in labour or in kind to keep the kuls in repair. But residents of Kibber, Losar and Sagnam villages complain the irrigation department's intervention and the lack of labour because of alternative job opportunities have resulted in the breakdown of the traditional system.

Furthermore, the government's stipulation that kul water must be distributed equally is jeopardising the valley's traditional social order and the bada ghars face the loss of both control over water and their position in the village hierarchy.

However, the disbanding of the traditional hierarchies does not automatically result in egalitarianism because the emerging social order is based on market forces and money power. This means that access to kul water will no longer be based on availability and need and the monetisation of this resource will leave many of Spiti's families impoverished.

### Waste management scenario in Uttarakhand :

India presently generates 53 Million Tons Per Annum (MTPA) out of which only 46% (around 24 MTPA) is processed. Uttarakhand generates approximately 1406 Tons Per Day (TPD) and none of this is getting processed. According to the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs,, out of the earlier 912 wards (pre delimitation of wards) across the state’s urban local bodies, only 3% of the wards actually practiced 100% source segregation. Another reply in Rajya Sabha on 8 March 2018 revealed that only 5 crores has been released, out of the allocated 57 crores allocated for Solid Waste Management since 2014 for Uttarakhand.

Apart from numbers, the policy and legal compliance remains flouted and almost negligible on ground. In 2017, the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) conducted a performance audit of ULBs with respect to waste management and revealed that ULBs of Dehradun and Haridwar city are not following the Municipal Solid Waste (Management & Handling) Rules 2016 notified by Government of India (GoI). The report also revealed that segregation at the household level remains practically zero, which is in contempt of the rules.

As per a study published in Journal of Basic & Applied Sciences (Wani & Ahmed, 2013), Srinagar (another rapidly urbanizing town of Uttarakhand), is struggling to scientifically manage the waste. The study shares a very simple fact that the city has only one dumping landfill which is being used since 1987 for waste disposal. Collection efficiency remains extremely low in the city.

The capacity of the Sewage Treatment Plants (STPs) at Haridwar and Rishikesh was inadequate for handling the waste discharge of the town, resulting in untreated sewage being discharged into the river. The STPs at Devprayag and Rishikesh were also under*utilised due to deficient planning and lack of coordination between the executing agencies. 

Worst condition in Uttarkashi :

Uttarkashi, with a population of 17,475 (Census 2011) produces 7*9 tons of waste per day, according to the Uttarakhand Environment Protection and Pollution Control Board (UEPPCB)’s 2017 numbers. The town is also not equipped with door to door collection of waste facility. However, UEPPCB in its annual report has claimed that it has provided Nagar Palika Parishad (NPP) with all the requisite waste management tools like 60 dustbins and 30 containers (though it is not clear why it is the PCB’s job to provide infrastructure). The Uttarkashi NPP has also been provided with a tractor trailer, two refuse collectors and fourteen tricycles. The entire waste of Uttarkashi town is to be emptied in pits constructed for waste dumping at Mahidanda road.

However in practice, municipal waste was earlier being dumped in a local water stream named Tekhla. In October 2018, the High Court intervened and stopped the dumping in Tekhla stream. Thereafter the Uttarkashi NPP started using Ramlila Maidan (Ground) for dumping the waste.

Post the ULB elections in the state in November 2018, the government decided to hold the swearing in ceremony of Uttarkashi NPP’s Councilors and Chairman at the Ramlila Maidan followed by a grand rally by Trivendra Rawat, the Uttarakhand Chief Minister in the same location. As a result, right after the completion of swearing*in ceremony, the entire garbage was dumped in the Bhagirathi River to ensure the ground was cleared of garbage for the CM’s rally.

Rudraprayag, a small Himalayan town, having a population of 9,313 (Census 2011) was also in the news for the same reason, the only difference was that the river changed. The Rudraprayag Municipality was caught illegally dumping the solid waste in the Alaknanda River. Prior to this, in November 2018, an expedition team of CISF conducted a cleanup drive in areas close to Rudraprayag, where non*degradable plastic was rotting since last many years. This was mostly because of the large number of tourists here.

Way forward :

Solid waste management remains a crucial area of intervention from development policy and sustainability planning point of view. Uttarakhand, placed in an extremely fragile ecological zone, is currently reeling under enormous quantity of waste being generated by its towns and cities, which are also urbanizing at a rapid pace added with extra pressure from floating population of tourists.

Along with unified policy actions at a state level, technically innovative and sustainable measures needs to be adopted by local city governments.As per the Solid Waste Management Rules 2016, ULBs have key responsibilities including door*to*door waste collection mechanism, managing segregated streams of waste, setting up of decentralized compost plants etc.However the ULBs in India are plagued by their own set of fundamental problems like budget constraints, manpower shortage, lack of technical expertise, inadequate political legitimacy and representation which makes it difficult for them to execute their routine civic tasks. The same issues have hampered the performance of ULBs in Uttarakhand.For instance, Dehradun ranked 21 out of the 23 cities in Annual Survey of India’s City Systems (ASICS), India’s first and only independent benchmarking of cities using a systemic framework, developed by Bengaluru based Janaagraha. In urban governance, the city of Dehradun was able to score only 3.1 marks out of 10. The average income of Dehradun Municipal Corporation (DMC) stood at Rs. 13 crore in comparison to Lucknow’s 256 crore. The per capita expenditure of DMC stood at Rs. 546, one of the lowest. The short tenures of Municipal Commissioners and inadequate political freedom to corporation (despite 73rd and 74th Constitutional amendments) have further exacerbated the problem. Making cities zero waste, hundred percent resource recovery and promoting sustainable and zero waste tourism must find place in the waste management vision of the state government. Without this, the ULBs will continue to dispose of waste in rivers, polluting the environment and violating the law of the land.

Mid*Himalayan Watershed Development Project :

The Mid*Himalayan Watershed Development Project (MHWDP) is a 222,951 ha (550,920 acres) land husbandry initiative in Himachal Pradesh, India that aims by means of green growth and sustainable development to establish a functionally tenable watershed ecosystem. MHWDP has started to reverse several decades of degradation of the natural resource base including forests, has achieved improved agricultural yields and productivity, and has raised rural household incomes. It includes the Himachal Pradesh Reforestation Project (HPRF), the world’s largest clean development mechanism (CDM) project.

Background :

The Mid*Himalayan Watershed Development Project (MHWDP) is an administrative unit of the Department of Forests of the Government of Himachal Pradesh. MHWDP stakeholders are the Department of Forests, local gram panchayats (GPs), and the World Bank. The project aims to reverse several decades of degradation of the natural resource base and improve the productive potential and incomes of the rural households in the project areas. Using a community*driven development approach, MHWDP aims to improve water harvesting, increase the area under irrigation to diversify agriculture and horticulture, and conserve and sustainably develop soil and water resources.

MHWDP covers 222,951 ha in the watersheds of Mid*Himalayan region in the Siwalik Hills between 600 and 1800 metres above mean sea level. It encompasses the catchment areas for three major rivers of Northern India, the Ravi, [[River Bea]] and Sutlej.These rivers [[join]] the Indus, which carries water that sustains more than 200 million people.The project covers 11 watershed divisions and involves 704 gram panchayats located in 43 blocks spread over 10 districts of the state.

MHWDP manages a subproject, the Himachal Pradesh Reforestation Project (HPRP), also called the HP Bio*Carbon Reforestation Project*Improving Livelihoods and Watersheds. HPRP implements Afforestation and Reforestation Clean Development Mechanism (A/R CDM) activities, initially on 4,003.07 ha but subsequently expanded to approximately 10,000 ha of degraded lands.[citation needed] MHWDP will manage HPRP until 2013 or beyond. The State Forest Department will subsequently manage the project. HPRP was registered with the UNFCCC 30 Jun 2011.

Overview :

The natural habitats of Himachal Pradesh exhibit a high degree of endemism, referring to species only found in these areas. Watershed management aims at multifaceted environmental benefits such as habitats for biodiversity, soil conservation, reduced sedimentation, and improved forest cover.

The forests of the Himachal Pradesh watersheds are an important carbon sink for greenhouse gases.Trees naturally sequester carbon dioxide, contributing about 90% of the earth's surface carbon storage. A cubic foot of merchantable wood retains approximately 15 kg of carbon. The UN recognised carbon trading as mitigating greenhouse gas emissions. The approximate international market value of one tonne of carbon is USD 19.

Himachal Pradesh endeavors to become the first carbon*neutral state in India. The A/R CDM project is developed under the umbrella of the World Bank funded MHWD Project and it expected to sequester 828,016 units CO2*e of Certified Emission Reductions (tCER) commonly known as carbon credits, each unit being equivalent to the reduction of one metric tonne of CO2e, e.g. CO2 or its equivalent)

India's first clean development mechanism (CDM) projectcarbon emissions will be reduced by 40,000 tonnes per year for a 20*year crediting period from the year 2006.can be extended to total 60 yearsproject is registered for carbon credits by the UN under which the World Bank will buy carbon credits from the new forests/ plantations being developed on degraded areas in 177 gram panchayats covering around 4,000 hectare land falling in 10 districts of the state.impact an area of 4,003.07 hectareslargest project of its kind in the world,strong incentive to protect forest cover in the area.
The carbon revenues were calculated at US $5 per tonne of carbon dioxide accumulated in tree biomass, above as well as under the ground. This equates to approximately Rs 2,500 per hectare, depending on growth of trees and other factors.

Accountability :

Emphasis was given to assuring transparency and accountability of governmental oversight and project decision making. To facilitate broad participation ownership of the program, the Himachal Pradesh government conducted consultations with key stakeholders, and also chartered the World Wildlife Fund to independently assess and report on stakeholder views. Velander analyzed the MHWDP model, which implements project goals and objectives through the pre*existent local governments, the Gram Panchayats.

Achievements :

MHWDP has enabled over 200 km of irrigation channels as well as over 6,000 water harvesting tanks, over 1,000 ponds, nearly 300 dams and over 260 lift or gravity irrigation schemes, and has converted about 9,000 hectares of rain*fed land into irrigated acreage, benefiting some 100,000 families.Scaling up vermicomposting and other sustainable agriculture practices increases the organic matter content of the soil, and the enhanced water retention capacity facilitates sustainable and productive agriculture.

At mid*term review in November, 2009, the project had already surpassed its end*of*project target of 50 per cent increased agricultural yield, achieving increased paddy (236 percent), maize (163 per cent), wheat (90 per cent), and milk yields (11 percent). Approximately 10,000 farmers had modified their cultivation and marketing approaches, including adopting higher value crops such as vegetables and spices.1500 farmers were grouped into milk federations connected to milk chilling plants. Overall household incomes had risen 13 percent, largely on account of project extension services, particularly improved agricultural production technologies and market linkages.

Other states in India are looking to replicate the Himachal carbon credit project. It has seen as a potential showcase for other countries in South Asia. After getting the Mid*Himalayan Watershed Development Project registered with the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), Himachal Pradesh has become the first state in India to implement the clean development mechanism (CDM) project.

Financing :

The World Bank and Himachal Pradesh state government project is financed by a credit from the International Development Association (IDA), the World Bank's concessionary lending arm. International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) is acting as trustee for BioCarbon Fund (BioCF) DNASpain is the source of funding to IDA. The green development loan is for $200 million USD.The loan agreement was signed between the World Bank and the state government in New Delhi on 28 July 2012.Funding consists of a 90 per cent grant and a 10 per cent loan at interest rate of 0.7 per cent (payable in 30 years).

Although only 1 of 76 projects and just 200 million USD of World Bank's USD 23 billion portfolio in India, HPRF is the world’s largest and India's first clean development mechanism (CDM) project. The United Nations has registered MHWDP for carbon trading scheme under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. The bank will buy carbon credits from the new forests being developed.The loan program breaks new ground and has the potential for significant demonstration effects in promoting the green growth agenda.

Word Bank project to cover 102 more villagesThe project got approval on 6 September 2012 and the proposed closing date of this project is 30 September 2013.

# Himachal government succeeds in protecting endangered Chamurthi horses
## About
![[media/himachal*pradesh/hp*env/chamurthi*horses.png]]
* Chamurthi horse breed which was among those horse breed that were in danger of becoming extinct few years back.
* known for better ability and endurance skills 
* is found in the upper mountainous areas of Himachal mainly in snow bound Spiti valley at least as early as the Indus Valley (Harrapan) civilization. 
* This breed is one of the six recognized breeds of Indian horses which is known for its stamina during high*altitude journeys
* It has been used by the Tibetans, Ladhakhis and Spitians for war and to carry their goods and is widely used for various domestic and commercial use in  Kullu, Lahaul and Spiti and Kinnaur area of the Himachal and adjoining states.
## Protection
* The Animal Husbandry Department set up a horse breeding farm in the year 2002, in Lari (Spiti), 
* divided into three separate units having capacity of 20 horses in each.
## Success
* Their population has now touched a high figure of around four thousand in Himachal Pradesh at present.
* The majority of the yearlings produced each year are sold to the locals and individual buyers through auction by the Animal Husbandry department, at 40 to 80 thousand
* The success and popularity of Chamurthi horses can be easily measured by various awards won during international Lavi and Ladarcha fairs and other exhibitions from time to time in recent years.
