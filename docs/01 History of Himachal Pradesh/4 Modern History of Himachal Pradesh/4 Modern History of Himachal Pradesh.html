HINT- â™¦ Giving sanad â™¦ policy of intervention â™¦ recruitment of superintendents in the <br />
formation of cantonments Â· â™¦ cantonments in the principals of the state â™¦ laps policy. <br />
(i) Construction / Establishment of British Cantonments : At present, there are 62 Cantonment areas in the <br />
country, which are under the Ministry of Defence of the Central Government. Himachal Pradesh also has seven <br />
Cantonment areas which were established in British period. These cantonments are : <br />
â™¦ Subathu: Subathu is located in District Solan. This was the military camp of Gorkhas in 1814-15. After the <br />
Gorkha defeat in the fort at Malaun, the British established a cantonment in Subathu in May 1815. It was <br />
the Nasiri Regiment created by defeated Gorkha soldiers. Before the Hindustan-Tibet road construction <br />
(1850 AD), this camp was very important. L.ieutenant ROSS was appointed political observer in this area. <br />
Kennedy stayed in Subathu before going to Shimla. William Bentinck came to Subathu for a trip in 1829. <br />
â™¦ Kasauli : Solang district located in Kasauli, was the second cantonment e.stablished by the British in <br />
Hirnachal Pradesh. It was established in 1842 AD. Previously, there was the Fort of Gorakhas, which was <br />
used during the Gorkha-British War. Kasauli's name lies on Kasaul village. The soldiers of Kasauli were <br />
robbed of the treasury in 1857 and they had got away from Nasiri Battalion of Jutogh. <br />
â™¦ Jutogh : Jutogh Cantt (situated in Shirnla district) was the third campus established by the British in <br />
Hirnachal Pradesh in 1843 AD. The British soldiers captured the Gorkha Regiment in 1814-15 in the Gorkha <br />
war, and later it was made a cantonment in 1843 AD. In 1857, unqer the leadership of Subedar Bhirn Singh, <br />
the Nasiri battalion of Jutogh"-r~olted. <br />
â™¦ Dagshai : Solan district located at~tional Highway-22 (NH-5) in Dagshai (6078 feet high) was a Gorkha <br />
fort during Gorkha-British War. Dagshlri,Cantonment was established in 1847 AD by acquiring five villages <br />
from Maharaja BhupinderSingh of Patial~ere the prisoners were kept in the Mughal period. It is named <br />
after the "Daag-e-Shahi" (Royal Stamp). Here ' a--c~ntral jail was also established in 1849. Four freedom <br />
fighters of Komagata Maru were_ hanged here. The Irish soldiers rebelled here in the year 1920. Â· <br />
â™¦ Bakloh: Chamba district located in Bakloh was made a Cantonment in 1866. It is a cantonment of Category-4. <br />
It became the encampment of Gorkh&amp; soldiers. <br />
â™¦ Dalhousie: Dalhousie was founded by Lord Dalhousie in 1.854 AD. The camp here was established in <br />
1867. King Shri Singh of Chamba principality sent his soldier Dalhousie to help the British in the rebellion <br />
of 1857. <br />
â™¦ Yol: The British Army was established in Yol (Kangra) in 1849, but it got the status of cantonment in 1942. <br />
â™¦ Most of the cantonments established b:x â€¢he British Government in Himachal Pradesh are in the forts used <br />
by Gorkha during the Gorkha-British wa Â·. Most of the military encampments have been built by the Gorkha <br />
soldiers who did not go, to Nepal after the Gorkha-British war of 1814-15. <br />
(ii) British Administrative Policies for Hill States : After the Anglo-Gorkha War (1815 AD), the subordinate <br />
principals of the Gorkhas came under the protection of the British. Similarly, after the first Anglo-Sikh war <br />
(1846 AD), the princely states which were in control of the Sikhs, came under the control of all the English. The <br />
British followed the following type of policy after 1815 AD to the hill states. <br />
â™¦ Establishing British occupation by the Sanad <br />
â€¢ Â· 'Sanad' is a type of deed, which was e:onferred by the British Empire for loc;al lordships allegiance to their <br />
British government. The 'Sanad' was recogniz~d by the ruler of the principality and his descendants to <br />
rule in his own kingdom. <br />
â€¢ After the Gorkha-British war, David Ochterlony convened a meeting of 20 hill states of Shimla in Palasi <br />
so that the areas acquired for Gorkha could be divided. As a result, Sirmaur (Fat~h Prakash, September <br />
21, 1815 AD), Bilaspur (Mahanchand, March 6, 1815 AD), Hindur (Ram Sharan Singh, September <br />
20, 1815 AD) Jubbal (Puranchand, 18 September, 1815 AD) Baghat (Mohinder Singh, 4th September, <br />
26 General Knowledge (Hiniachal Pradesh) <br />
1815 AD), Keonthal (Sansar Sen, power transfer in 1815; Sanand 5 April 1893), Baghal (Jagat Singh, <br />
3rd September, 1815 AD), State of Busha~r (Moh~der Singh, Febru~ry 8~ 1816) was h~ded ov~r to <br />
the respective owners of the state. Accordmg to this sanad, he and his childre1: were given the nght <br />
to rule. Kumarsain (Rana Kehar Singh, 7 February 1816, AD), Balsan (YogaraJ, September 21, 1815 <br />
AD), Tharoch (Jhobu, 31 January 1819 AD), Mangal (Bahadur Shah, 20 Septembe~, 1815 A:D~, Dhami <br />
(Govardhan Singh, September 4, 1815. AD) sanads were confer:ed on <em>the thakuraiyo as distinct. The <br />
trenches of Khaneti and Delath were subjected to Bushahr while Koti, Ghund, Theog, Madhan and <br />

[4 Marks, Sample Paper GS Paper-1, HPAS (Main)] <br />
Q. 3. What do you think of the Bethu system? Discuss. <br />
HINT- Please see part (i) for this. <br />
(i) Beth : The practice of getting service from lower castes without wages by the upper castes is called Beth. Here, <br />
Beth was occupied by Shimla Hill State in a manner similar to Jajmani system. Lower castes used to work like <br />
the servants of the upper castes, which included all kinds of work. The Koli caste was mostly a Beth provider. <br />
These people used to provide service without wages in land of the Jagirdars which is called Basa. The practice <br />
of exchange of Beths was also popular. If the land was given to the girl in the form of dowry then the people <br />
who got the land would have got Beths also. 'f!lese Beths did not get the right of ownership of the land. The <br />
people of the lower castes also used to do the lower works for the brotherhood of the village. According to 1889 <br />
Shimla District Gazette, Koll Beth were 20 percent of the district in the division; 96% land was in possession of <br />
Jagirdars in kotkhai who used to Beth from the lower castes. Beth wages were also popular in Rampur Bushahr. <br />
Beth system was also popular in reserved forests in British period. <br />
Instead of 'Beth' service, 'Chak' (food), 2 pairs of cloths and one-tenth of the crop was given. Later, in 1940, <br />
instead of Chak (food) 3 'Ana' were given for the day and 12 to 18 rupees per year instead of the share of crop. In <br />
the British cantonment areas, many people used to pay cash in exchange for service, in which work like porter, <br />
hand rickshaw driver was included. In 1939, the British asked the loeal kings to give land ownership rights to <br />
Â·the Beths. Make arrangements for giving land to the peopli, on which they were working or compensation of <br />
land. On August 24, 1943, the Shimla Hill State ended up making a policy by establishing Â·a policy of Beth <br />
and Begar. Beths of the State got free.dom from all forms of slavery except raising sedan (Palki Uthana). Beths <br />
who were working on the lands for three generations, were given ownership right of the land by the Jagirdars <br />
and the rest-were given the rightto get ownership of the land by paying compensation. Beth system has not <br />
been completely eliminated. It has now taken the form of cash wages. <br />
(ii) Begar: The practice of getting work done without wages from the people is called Begar. The Begar work done <br />
by the lowers castes for the upper castes is called Beth, which we have described already. Apart from this, <br />
people we:r:e also made to Begar by the State. Two forms of Begar were prevalent. <br />
â™¦ Athwara Begar : In Athwara Begar, work was done witho~t wages throughout the year in which the <br />
following types of work included- <br />
â€¢ Freight load <br />
â€¢ . Checkposts, Guarding of checkposts <br />
32 General Knowledge (Himachal Pradesh) <br />
â€¢ Postal service and sending messages from one state to another <br />
â€¢ Road construction and maintenance <br />
â€¢ Performing tasks such as labour, cooking, playing drums and chasing prey for British officers on <br />
hunting <br />
â€¢ Bring woods and grass for royal families <br />
â™¦ Hela Begar : On some special occasions such as birth, death, marriage, etc., Begar which was performed by <br />
the King, was called Hela Begar. In this, the Brahmins, Rajputs, Gram Devata and the Royal People were <br />
exempted from work. In this period, the Jagirdars had to do Begar in the important State subjects. <br />
â€¢ Sanad : British authorities recognized the practice of Begar during Sanad in 1815 and its types, quantity <br />
etc. were mentioned in Sanads. <br />
â€¢ Dumha Movement: Against Begar, there was a Dumha movement led by the Kanets. Koli people were <br />
also with them. These people did not give Begar and in protest the whole village used to flee. These <br />
people used to leave the village moving on to the jungles and high hills. Sometimes these movements <br />
became violent too. In 1854, in Rampur Bushahr, farmers stopped working in fields against the <br />
British revenue system. In Sirmaur in 1880, the Dumh movement became violent. There was a Dumh <br />
movement in Bhagal State against Athwara l3egar in 1905. In 1909, Shobharam launched a movement <br />
on the lines of Dumha movement, in Mandi. There was a public protest movement against Begar. <br />
Pajota Movement, Dhami Movement etc. were all against the Begar system. <br />
â€¢ End of the Begar System : Satyanand Stokes launched a movement for the end of the Begar system. In <br />
the year 1939, in Ludhiana, All India State People Congress, Nehru expressed concern about the Begar <br />
system. Political Representative of the hill states of Punjab (Political Agent) started investigating the <br />
system of Begar in 1941. On August 24, 1943, the hill states of Shimla created a policy and ended the <br />
system of Beth and Begar. Under the pressure of the Praja Manda! movement and the pressure of the <br />
National Movement, the hill states of Shimla had to end the begar system. <br />
(iii) Reet : Meaning of 'Reet' is the value of jewelery and clothing given to the wife at the time of marriage by <br />
the Husband. In this, other related expenses related to him are also added. When the relationship of -spouse <br />
becomes tense, the girl goes to her parents' house. If the father of the girl becomes ready to give his son-in-law <br />
the amount of custom and 'one rupee' which is called 'Ched Karai', then the divorce process is complete. One <br />
of the eight marriages of the Shastras resembled it with the Asura marriage. Â· <br />
â™¦ Sirmaur Gazette : According to the Sirmaur Gazette, the Reet is a contract wedding that the woman can <br />
break by giving compensation. <br />
â™¦ Dr. Y.S. Parmar : According to Dr. Y.S. Parmar, Reet was a system of arranged marriage for some and <br />
remarriage or divorce for some. In Kangra, Bushahr, Kullu, Siraj, Lahaul they considered the Reet as a <br />
marriage, whereas in Sirmaur it was a form of div.orce. In Sirmaur, the woman could return Reet to her <br />
husband and choose other husband and the previous husband could not even refuse to accept Reet. He <br />
could object to the amount of Reet. <br />
â™¦ Colonel Base : In 1925 Colonel Base did not consider it a marriage, but the exemption of compensation for <br />
first husband and exemption for second marriage with her own will. <br />
â™¦ Reet was a temporary marriage in which no ceremony was held. In this, the woman used to make her lover <br />
as her new husband, if he (lover) would return the bride money to her first husband, he gave the woman's <br />
parents at the time of marriage. It was prevalent in the upper Shimla and Sirmaur of Himachal Pradesh. At Â· <br />
Rampur Bushahr, at the time of marriage, the husband used to give ornaments and clothes to his wife, in <br />
many places, the price was fixed from Rs 100 to 2000 rupees. Reet was popular in Himachal Jubbal, Bushahr, <br />
' Bhagal, Nalagarh, Theog, Bhajji, Dhami, Kunihar, Delath, Mandhan Mandi, Suket, Sirmaur, Chamba, <br />
Bilaspur. In Kangra, Kullu, Lahaul there was a variety of arrangements in the system. Reet marriage was <br />
rare in Brahmins, Rajputs, but reet were practiced in Koli, Bhat and Khaneti. <br />
â™¦ Himalaya Vidyalaya Sammelan Sabha (HVPS) : Demanded to abolish this in the Hindu Conference <br />
1924 in Shimla. In 1924, Thakur Surat Singh of the Himalaya Vidyalaya Parishad wrote a letter to the <br />
Superintendent of Shimla Hill State demanding to abolish this practice because it was promoting family <br />
disintegration and smuggling of women. . Â· . Â· <br />
â™¦ Streets of Hill State and Bntish Government : The British Government initially kept it apart sayir.g <br />
that it is the internal matter of the states; Raja Rana Dalip Singh of Baghat created a law against Reet <br />
in 1917, according to which the marriage of a married woman whose husband was alive was declared <br />
â–º <br />
History of Himachal Pradesh 33 <br />
illegal. Registration and inquiry of marriage was started tn Bhagal State in 1924. In the Bushehr princely <br />
state, inter-caste marriages were banned, in addition to the order of the Brahmans and Rajputs to perform <br />
theological marriages. <br />
Most of the kings took Reet' s side and opposed to ~he removal. Kati, Ratesh, Kahlur, Bhajji, Nalagarh, <br />
Â· Mandhan, Jubbal, Theog, Kuthar and Kuhmarmen Thakurai and principals refused to make laws on the <br />
ritual. Â· <br />
â™¦ Ended of Reet : Completion of the Rule in Himalaya Vidyalaya Sammelan Sabha and Under British <br />
pressure, on July 16, 1926, 21 hill states decided to eliminate the Reet and make rules related to marriage. <br />
â™¦ Effect of Reet : In addition to the bad effects of the influence of the Reet, some positive effects were also <br />
seen, such as decrease in virginity in Kangra, child marriage in other areas, widow marriage, easy divorce, <br />
bridegroom in place of dowry etc. empowers th~ situation. <br />

<dt>(iii) Events before 1857 AD : With the Treaty of Lahore, the hill kings became disillusioned with the British, because</dt>
<dt>the British did not give them their old Jagirs. Secondly, in the British-Sikh war (1848 AD), the princely states of</dt>
<dt>Kangra Hill supported the Sikhs against the British. Hills states of of Nurpur, Kangra, Jaswan and Dattarpur</dt>
<dt>revolted against the British in 1848, which was suppressed by Commissioner Lawrence. Everyone was arrested</dt>
<dt>and taken to Almora where he died. Wazir Ram Singh Pathania of Nurpur proved to be a tough knife for the</dt>
<dt>British. They defeated the British in "Dale Ki Dhar" near Shahpur. He was cheated by a Brahman Pahadchand.</dt>

<dt>dynasties of Kangra's hill kingdoms, there was discontent in the hill kings.</dt>
<dt>â™¦ Discriminatory Treat of Native Soldiers: Any Indian soldier could not become a staff officer. Government</dt>
<dt>intervened in the 'social and religious life of the soldiers. The largest Indian officer in the army was under</dt>
<dt>the British Army's smallest British officer. They were also sent to fight outside India.</dt>
<dt>â™¦ Lord Dalhousie's Policy of Lapse (expenditure) was also the reason for the revolution of 1857 AD.</dt>
<dt>â™¦ Cartridges containing Fat (Charbi): New Rifles which are called the Enfield Rifles contains cow and pig fat</dt>

<dt>(i) Farmers Discontent and Mass Movement</dt>
<dt>(1) Bushahr State in Dumh : When any King used to do any such work or land tax, which people considered</dt>
<dt>to be unfair and unjust, would. have left the village to show their fury and protest and went-to the nearby</dt>
<dt>forest. It was called the Dumb Movement. Dumh agitators used to suffer from this, the power also got</dt>
<dt>disturbed by such agitation and made an immediate effort to fulfill the demands of the agitators. Dumh</dt>
<dt>movement was often organized and peaceful. After reconciliation, "the people would come back to their</dt>
<dt>homes and again they were engaged in farming and other activities. Â· Â·</dt>
<dt>In Bushahr state, in 1859 AD, there was a Dumh movement. Its main center was the area of Rohru. There</dt>
<dt>were many reasons for this, but mainly it was against the rneasurement of land in 1854 AD. Tehsildar</dt>
<dt>Shyamlal, resident of Nurpur, arranged the land at that time and fixed cash levy. Earlier, in the form of land</dt>
<dt>yield, certain parts of the produce, food, ghee, oil, wool, sheep and goat etc. had to be given to the state in</dt>
<dt>the form of tax. This movement was also related to the then state system. In these years, the tradition of the</dt>
<dt>dynasty Waziris was abolished. The1 ,fore, the Puari Wazirs of Kinnaur also threw this movement. At th~t</dt>
<dt>ti.me there was lack of money for giving malguzari. The British government intervention was necessary</dt>
<dt>to end this Dumh movement. First to resolve this, Deputy Commissioner of Shimla William Hay and</dt>
<dt>superintendent of the states went to George Camac Barnes Bushahr and discussed with King Shamsher</dt>
<dt>Singh. There were three demands of agitating farmers. First, eliminate the leasing system of that time,</dt>
<dt>secondly, handing over power to the dynasty W, ,irs and third, to collect the rent from conventional way</dt>
<dt>through produce and commodities. Su1 ,,,rintenc.. .:!nt Barnes accepted the three demands, considering the</dt>
<dt>seriousness of the movement. Thus tk Â· rmerÂ· of Bushahr succeeded in conforming his demands to the</dt>
<dt>King and the British Government m d thL movement ended.</dt>
<dt>History of Hlmachal Pradesh</dt>
<dt>(2) Movement in Theog and Beja : In 1898, the Beja people protested against Thakur and capturt"d thÂ· two</dt>
<dt>soldiers of the princely state. Uday Chand, ruler of Beja, suppressed this movement with the h â€¢Ip of h</dt>
<dt>British government. Some leaders 0f the agitators were arrested . In 1898, the farmer protc. ted again t the</dt>
<dt>disturbances in settlement in Theog-Thakurai and they refused to give up. The state government re lax d</dt>
<dt>the people with the help of the British Government.</dt>
<dt>(3) Land movement in Baghal: In 1897, in the time of Raja Dhyan Singh of Baghal state, during the period of</dt>
<dt>1897 AD to 1902 AD, people started the agitation against excessive landlord. Farmers raised their agi tation</dt>
<dt>against huge increase in land rent, lack of pasture and prohibition of killing wild animals, which de rayed</dt>
<dt>their crops. The Brahmins of the village of Barog made huge sacrifices in the village and they went to</dt>
<dt>the king too. On the intervention of the British government, the state government relaxed the people by</dt>
<dt>imposing the penalty, which ended the agitation.</dt>
<dt>The revolt spread in Baghal princely in 1905 AD. When King Vikram Singh sat on the throne in l 904, he</dt>
<dt>was minor at that time. Therefore, the state's management was in the hands of Mian Maan Singh. The</dt>
<dt>beginning of this movement started with the patchwork of the Raj family, but later all the Kanait people of</dt>
<dt>the area revolted against the King's representative, the ruler and his brother. People stopped paying extra.</dt>
<dt>Unrest spread in, the state. In the end, the English superintendent of the hill states of Shimla went to the</dt>
<dt>capital Arki of Baghal and intervened and calm the agitators by giving assurances of justice. Along with</dt>
<dt>that Mian Sher Singh was transferred from Kumarsain to a council member. He started the land settlement</dt>
<dt>and made other reforms to establish peace.</dt>
<dt>(4) Revolt in Dodra Kwar: In region, which took p lace along with Garhwal of Bushahr in 1906 D, revolted</dt>
<dt>in Dodra Kwar. This area was administered by Raja to Ran bahadur Singh, a resident of the village of</dt>
<dt>P-0wari of Kinnatir village. He revolted against the king and tried to subdue the Dodra-Kwar to subdue it.</dt>
<dt>He stopped depositing the state's income in the treasury of Bu hahr. The people there also rebelled against</dt>
<dt>the Bushahr state in support of him, because Ranbahadur was a nationalist of that time. In the end, he was</dt>
<dt>caught in Shimla by arresting the command of the English officer of Sh imla hill principals in 1906, and wa</dt>
<dt>taken captive. He accepted accepting back the government's income. When he was ill, he was released from</dt>
<dt>prison. He died in Shimla.</dt>
<dt>(5) Farmer movement in Kunihar and Movement against Begar : In 1920, the farmers protested again t the</dt>
<dt>atrocities of the administration of the Kunihar State. People raised voice against Rana. The state government</dt>
<dt>suppressed this movement with the help of the British and stopped those who provoked sent in jail. In</dt>
<dt>1921, Babu Kanshi Ram of Kunihar and Satyanand Stokes of Kotgarh raised their voice agains t la very in</dt>
<dt>hill states. Satyanand Stokes launched agitation in the hill states against begar system. In order to crea te</dt>
<dt>awareness among the people, he wrote several articles and held a conference at the place of place. In 1921,</dt>
<dt>Stokes also held a conference in Rampur, capital of Bushahr princely state. After this, the king of Bushahr,</dt>
<dt>Padam Singh (1914-1947) assured the resignation of the residency.</dt>
<dt>(6) Theog Movement : In the October of 1926, the public protested against the administration of Rana</dt>
<dt>Padmachand (1909) in Theog Thakurai in October 1926. Its leader was his brother Mian Khadak Singh. But</dt>
<dt>later this movement fell loosely and Kharak Singh settled in Khaneti Thakurai along with his family. In</dt>
<dt>1927, Mian Kharak Singh again started this movement with Khaneti. This time, Rana's son Karamchand</dt>
<dt>and Rajmata also supported the public in open form. In order to suppress this movement, Rana sought the</dt>
<dt>help of the British Government. So Deputy Commissioner Salisbury sent the police to Shim.la. The police</dt>
<dt>arrested Mian Kharak Singh and dispersed the people.</dt>
<dt>(7) Mass Movement in Suket</dt>
<dt>1</dt>
<dd>King Ugrasen's (1836-1876) Wazir Narotam was very tyrannical. He punished <br />
some Brahmin families. People opposed it and demanded to arrest him, but the king continued to keep <br />
this task forward. The king's son Rudra Sen also opposed that wazir. Finally, the king removed him and <br />
made Dhangul a wazir in his place. It also started collecting heavy penalties from upper class people. One <br />
day Dhangul Wazir went on a visit to the hill region. On this, people caught hold of him and kept him in a <br />
confinement place for twelve days. They left him only when the king ordered him to leave. Raja heard the <br />
complaints of people by going to Garh Chabasi. Raja, after seeing the corrupt Dhangul wazir' s crimes, fined <br />
him twenty thousand rupees and punished him fo~ nine months. <br />
In 1878, Rudrasen sat on the throne. He made Dhangul a wazir. He has increased the land tax of farmers. <br />
This caused dissatisfaction among the people. People demanded justice from the king, but the king did <br />
not pay any attention to it. With this they became disappointed and they came to the movement. The <br />
people of the dynasty also supported the people. The king fired these people from the state. When the <br />
situation worsened, Jalandhar Commissioner Tremletrait Suket came. He investigated the whole situation. <br />

to exploit farmers by exploiting them with various kinds of taxes. He also increased the employment <br />
for the people. Corruption in the princely state also increased greatly. In such a situation, Sarkaghat of <br />
Shobharam area came to Mandi near the king with a complaint of 20 men and accompanied by their <br />
grievances. This time even the king did not pay any attention to them. For the third time, he came to the <br />
king with 300 men. At this time some people started arresting for the movement. In the end, under the <br />
leadership of Shobharam, the procession of nearly 20,000 farmers reached Mandi. The aggrieved farmers <br />
seized tehsildar Hardev and other officials and locked them in jail and captured court and police station. <br />

state, house, customs and marriage were impermissible tax. Employees started taking more employment <br />
than people. Farmers gathered in the village of Taproli in Pajota on October, 1942 and formed "Pajota Kisan <br />

of this movement was in the hands of Vaidya Surat Singh: He wrote to Raja Rajendra Prakash requesting <br />
him to visit the area to know the problems of the people himself. The Sirmaur king was reliant on the <br />
flattery of Rajendra Prakash. The employees did not let the King meet the people. Hence, in the operation <br />
of the police officer, Raja sent the police village, Dhamla, Habban. He could not suppress the movement. <br />
After t.his the entire Pajota area was subjected to military rule. For two months people continued to agitate <br />

(ii) Activities related to Freedom Movement in Himachal Pradesh. th f t <br />
(1) The Establishment of the Indian National Congress : Indian National Congress has ~ en</em> on e . irsd <br />
place in the run agiÂ·t atiÂ· on for iÂ· ndependence o f t h e country. The iÂ·m a gmÂ· a. tion of the orgaruzation a retirke <br />
Scotlandian Allan Octavian Hume from the Indian Service, was of the view that the Congress sho~ld ta e <br />
only the social problem, but when he placed his mind in front of G~:,vemor General L~rd Duffenn, the~ <br />
Dufferin As a suggestion, he gave his opinion that keeping the Indian nation-welfare m 1ght, keep thi <br />
institution as an independent political entity. Its first session was concluded in Bom_bay, on 28 December, <br />
1885, at the recent Gokuldas Tejpal Sanskrit College. Among the main representatives were_A_.O. <em>Hu~e <br />
from Shimla. The conference was convened by Barrister Womesh Chandra Banerjee. Initially this mshtution <br />
had no malice to the British power. At that time, its purpo e was to make Indians in the admini~tratio~ and <br />
to make appointments on high posts. By this time, higher officials were employed by the Bntish officers. <br />
Over time, its policies changed and it became a political entity of the country. <br />
(2) Establishment of Ghadar Party : At that time, outside the country, foreign countries were also engaged <br />
in the independence of the Indian nation. In 1911, Lala Hardayal escaped from India and went to San <br />
Francisco, located in the US, France. In the year 1913, on his initiative, and in the memory of the 1857 mutiny, <br />
the summer started a 'Ghadar' newspaper. In the same year, in the conference of representatives of various <br />
Indian communities in"the United States, the organization of Indian Association was established and its <br />
Â·chief leaders became Hardayal. It was soon changed its name to the Ghadar Party. There were branches in <br />
many countries. In America this weekly newspaper "Ghadar" was used in many Indian languages. <br />
In 1913, Mandi's Hardev Ram left the job of a teacher and reached Japan via the United States. From there <br />
they went to Shanghai. There he met Dr. Mathura Singh, leader of the Ghadar Party. Leaving the goal of <br />
attaining higher education, Hardev Ram joined the Ghadar Party. In 1914, with a lot of literature of Lala <br />
Hardayal's Ghadar Party, Hardev returned to India after becoming a revolutionary and started preaching <br />
the Ghadar Party. He did a lot of work in Mandi too. <br />
(3) Mandi Conspiracy: The incident of conspiracy of 1914-15 happened to be affected by the Ghadar Party. <br />
When some people of the Ghadar Party came back from the US and the heat started some work to make their <br />
supporters in the people of Mandi and Suket's princely state. He encouraged people by reading 'Ghadar <br />
echo' literature. Rani Khairgarhi of Mandi and Mian Jawahar Singh came under her influence. Rani helped <br />
the people by giving them money. After the secret meetings in December 1914 and January 1915, it was <br />
decided that the police officer and the deputy should be killed and the government. funds should be <br />
robbed and the bridge made on the River Beas could be blown up. After this, the principals of Mandi and <br />
Suket have to be empowered. Only one Nagachala robbery or they failed in all their motives. As a result <br />
of this failure, Queen Khairagarhi was expelled from Mandi. The task of receiving the training of making <br />
a bomb by sending a lady from the Ghadar Party to 'Bhai Hridayaram' was assigned to Punjab. Bhai <br />
Hida Ram was caught in the clutches of the workers of this party and he was sentenced to life in Lahore <br />
conspiracy case. Later ~s sen!ence was changed into life imprisonment. In this trap, Hardev managed to <br />
flee and</em> he fled to ~adnna~ m Garhwal. !fe changed his name to Swami Krishnananda and joined the <br />
Congress p_arty ~d Jumped mto the non-VIolent movement of the Sinddh province in 1917. In the end, all <br />
the revolutionaries were caught and prosecuted and given long-term imprisonment. The chief among them <br />

Dalip Smgh, L~ngur~. ~ater, ~dayarrun was sent to Andamans for the punishment of black water <br />
(Saza-e-Kalaparu). After this Mandi revolutionary organization became weak. <br />
In ~e beginning of 1916,<em> the revol~tionaries of the Ghadar Party in Mandi, Suket and Una became active <br />
agam. They planned to kill the English of~cers. This time Mandi's workers were caught. Five of them were <br />
prosecuted and sentenced to fourteen to eighteen years. The distinction of the Krantik Dal of Un K tik <br />

[National Movement with special reference to Praja Manda! Movements in Himachal Pradesh (1848- <br />
1948)] . [HPAS (Main) GS Paper-1, Unit-I, Sub Unit-III] <br />
(i) All India State People Conference: At the end of the 19th ~entury and in the early 20th certtury, people of hill <br />
states became aware of the rapid progress. There too, the movement started to begin to set up a responsible <br />
government. The Congress also understood that it showed the way to the princely state. At the same time, <br />
Congress had to get ~ompl:te independence. It also included native principals. These princely states were <br />
only fragments of India, which could not be kept separate from India. On December 17, 1927, "All India States <br />
Peoples Conferencf' was formed in Bombay. Its first session was also in 1927. <br />
Ludh~a.n_a Confer~nce: On J5-16 February, 1939, the conference of '~11 India States People Conference" in <br />
Ludhiana was chaired by Jawaharlal Nehru. Pt. Nehru emphasized the establishment of the Praja Manda! in <br />
the princely states. He expressed the idea that the small princely states should be formed together so that the <br />
Â· organization is powerful. In this session in Ludhiana, Pt. Padamdev and Bhagmal Sohta were from the hill <br />
History of Himachal Pradesh 49 <br />
states of Shimla. Swami Purnanand from Mandi, Thakur Hitendra Singh from Sirmaur, Sadaram Chandel <br />
from Bilaspur, Vidya Sagar, Vidyadhar, Ghulam Rasul and Prithvi Singh from Chamba participated. <br />
Subsequently, these hill states started to grow rapidly. <br />
(ii) The formation of the Praja Mandal in Sirmaur : Being influenced by the proposals of the All India States <br />
Peoples Conference, formed the first public body institution of Himachal in Sirmaur. Its founder was Pt. <br />
Rajendra Dutt. He established his office in Ponta instead of Nahan. Chaudhary Sher Jung, Master Chatar <br />
Singh, Sh~li~ram</em> Sharma, Kundan Lal, Ajaib Singh etc. took active part in this. The first conference of Punjab <br />
and Pahan R1yash p~ople was held in Lud~iana on 12th October, 1930. In this, Sardar Bhagat Singh and two <br />
oth~rs from Sirmaur s ponta represented Smnaur Principality. In the same period, Pandit Shivanand Ramaul <br />
of Smnaur State started his agitational life by becoming a member of "Sirmauri Association" located in Delhi. <br />
Within the principality of Rajendra Dutt, he continued to operate it. In the year 1934, some people in Sirmaur <br />
kingdom established a Sirmaur Praja Mandal. In it, Dr. Devender Singh, Ramnath and Atma Ram became the <br />
founding members. <br />
In order to terrorize the people of Praja Mandal, the princely government prosecuted Dr. Devendra Singh, Hari <br />
Chand Padha, Atmaram, Indra Narayan and their associates. They were falsely accused of killing the Maharaja <br />
and throwing stones at his car. These days Yashwant Singh Parmar was the District and Sessions Judge of <br />
Sirmour. He favored the people of Praja Mandal in his decision related to this case and proved the allegation <br />
of murder of Maharaja on them false. This led to political differences with King Rajendra Prakash of Yashwant <br />
Singh Parmar. For this reason, p.e resigned from the job in 1941. At this the king expelled them from the princely <br />
state. He organized the Sirmauri's in Delhi from 1943 to 1946 and prepared them to fight for the attainment of <br />
democratic rights. <br />
(iii) Baghal, Theo and Jubbal Praja Mandal: On 11 August 1938, some people from Baghal, who worked in Shimla, <br />
held a meeting under the chairmanship of Jeevan Ram Chauhan and established the Baghal Praja Mandal. <br />
Mansha Ram Chauhan was made the minister of this Praja Mandal. Its purpose was to create awareness among <br />
the people about their rights. With this sentiment, Pt. Bhaskaranand formed the Praja Mandals in Bhajji, Surat <br />
Rama Prakash in Theog and Bhagmal Sohta in Jubbal. The work of formation of similar Praja Mandals started <br />
in the princely state of Kati, Kumarsain and Bushahr. <br />
(iv) Bushahr Praja Mandal: In order to reactivate the Bushahr Praja Manda! in 1945, other organizations of Bushahr <br />
like-Bushahar Reform Conference, Bushahr Prem Sabha and Sevak Mandal Delhi also organized the people of <br />
Bushahr. Pt. Padamdev worked for this in Shimla and was done by Pt. Ghanshyam and Satyadev Busheri and <br />
other leaders within the princely state. In later years_Negi Thakursain also started actively participating in Praja <br />
Mandal. Along with this, the Praja Mandals of Bilaspur, Jubbal and other areas also stepped up their activities. <br />
In this, Bhagrnal Sohta of Jubbal and Daulat Ram Sankhyan of Bilaspur participated enthÎ¼siastically. <br />
(v) Chamba Sevak Sangh : In the year 1936, some people in Chamba state formed an institution named "Chamba <br />
Sevak Sangh". Later this institution turned into a political organization. So the government banned this <br />
association. As a result, the Union made its center of activities, Dalhousie. <br />
On the other hand, the Praja Manda! of Chamba princely state demanded that a popular government should <br />
be formed in the pril:tcely state. Praja Manda! activists also voiced against feminism. He said that the Diwan <br />
of the princely state took all the rights into his own hands. As a result, many individuals were captured when <br />
the movement gained momentum. Gandhiji asked non-violence to launch a movement. The newspaper "The <br />
Tribune" wrote in the editorial, "Awakening has also taken place in the sleeping Chamba. Democratic views <br />
have crossed the hill barrier and reached the people of the princely state and they are asking for a responsible <br />
government. " , <br />
(vi) Mandi Praja Mandal : Hindi and Urdu newspapers were writing articles about the bad condition of Chamba. <br />
The Mandal was established in the 'year 1936. After Sirmaur it was the second praja Mandal in the hill states. <br />
Swami Pumanand became its president. With them were Ram Chand Malhotra, Baldev Ram, Harsukh <br />
Rai, Sunderlal and Moti Ram were prominent. Later, Krishna Chandra, Tej Singh Nidhak, Keshav Chandra, <br />
Padmanath and Hem Raj -also became members of the people. Mandi's ~ng imposed restrictions on the <br />
activities of the people. Â· <br />
(vi) Dhami Prem Pracharini Sabha : Many people here ~sed to work in Shimla because they were near the Shimla <br />
of the Dhami estate. In 1937, he made a 'Prem Pracharini Sabha' with the aim of improving his principality. <br />
Baba Narayan Das, who was employed in Shimla, was its president and Pt. Sita Ram was made a minister. <br />
Initially, its purpose was social and economic reform, but later it was also taking part in political work and <br />
talking about the movement. <br />
50 General Knowledge (Himachal Pradesh) <br />
(vii) Dhami Praja Mandal : Meanwhile, the "Prem Pracharini Sabha" of the Dhami princely state planned to join <br />
the princely Praja Manda! Shim la to avoid government repression. For this purpose, on 13 July 1939, under the <br />
chairmanship of Bhagmal Sohta, a meeting of the Praja Mandals of the hill states of Shimla was held at Ca mli <br />
loca tion near Kasumpti near Shimla. In this meeting the "Prem Pracharini Sabha" of Dhami princely state was <br />
changed to "Dhami Praja Manda]". Pt. Sita Ram of Dhami was appointed the head of this organization. On this <br />
occasion, a resolution was passed by the Dhami Praja Manda], in which the following demands were made <br />
from Rana Dhami :   </li>
<li>The Begar system should be abolished.   </li>
<li>Fifty percent reduction in land rent will be reduced.   </li>
<li>Dhami State Councils should be recognized.   </li>
<li>People should be given the freedom of civil rights.   </li>
<li>The restrictions and barriers imposed on the people of the state should be removed.   </li>
<li>The confiscated property of the members of the Prem Pracharini Sabha Dhami will be returned.   </li>
<li>A representative responsible government should be constituted in Dhami and the representatives of the <br />
public should be appointed in administrative work. Â· <br />
It was expressed in the proposal that if a reply from the ruler ofthe state did not get any response soon, then <br />
on July 16, a delegation Â·of seven persons would come from Halog and meet Rana. Manasa Ram was made a <br />
special representative and the demand letter was sent to Rana Dhami. Rana considers this letter to be an insult. <br />
He did not accept the demands of the people and did not respond to the proposal. On no reply, it was decided <br />
that on July 16, Bhagmal Sohta will depart from Shimla for Dhami and people will be attending their welcome <br />
at the playground, about one and a half miles away from the capital city of Halog, on July 16. On the other <br />

princely state of Shangri. It is headed by Satyadev Bushahri. A resolutio~ was passed <em>in this</em> conference, '.n <br />
which all the hill states were demanded to make a hill state. These people mcreased the1r pr ~ure on the hill <br />
52 General Knowledge (Himachal Pradesh) <br />
kings and demanded that they make a responsible government in their states. After attaining independence on <br />
15th August, 1947, due to sympathy with the people of_ the State Man~al of the G?vei:nme~t of India, the kings <br />
also began to establish responsible governments ~n their stat~s by se~mg the fragile si~a_t10n. . <br />
(xi i i) Representative Governments : Thakur of Kumhar appre_ciated this movement an? JOmed the people of h1s <br />
state in the administration. Seeing this, some other rulers did the same. On the occasion of Independence Day, <br />
Leader of the Legislative Assembly of the Theog states forced Rana Karamchand to quit power. After some <br />
time, Rana announced the Council of Ministers, which had 13 members. Mahatma Gandhi and Sardar Patel <br />
welcomed these steps, but after five months Rana captured the treasure with the help of some people. Armed <br />
police custody was sent to Sardar Patel's intervention. The ruler was captured and thrown out of there. Theog <br />
was the first princely state, which was found jn the Indian Union before Himachal Pradesh was formed. <br />
Jubbal king Digvijay Chandra made a committee of eight members in view of the time of the coming. It had <br />
five members elecfed and three nominated. Its task was to hear and remove people's complaints. Later, a <br />
representative government was formed, whose Chief Minister Bhagmal Sohta and Jailal Sharkholi, Washir <br />
Chand Negi, Babu Dula Ram Bhejta and Kunwar Raghuvar Singh became Mantri. The ministry continued <br />
working on April 15, 1948. Rana of the Koti announced the establishment of an assembly on November 25,   </li>
<li>In Bushahr, Satya Dev Bushahri started the Satyagraha movement in March 1947. For this reason many <br />
workers were caught. Seeing this, the state's employees started the agitation and made the "Employees Union"â€¢ <br />
The state government c1.ccepted their demand and accepted the offer of a representative meeting on April 18,   </li>
<li>Representatives of the people were not taken into confidence to establish this House of Representatives. <br />
So he passed the non-confidence motion. Elections were held in October 1947 and the People's Party won the <br />
election under the leadership of Satyadev Bushahri. <br />
After attaining independence, some people demanded that the hill kingdoms be merged with East Punjab. <br />
Eastern Punjab Governor Chandu Lal Trivedi and Chief Minister Gopi Chand Bhargava also wrote a letter to <br />
Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru and Sardar Patel that the hill states should be merged with East Punjab but the rulers <br />
and the people of these princely states stubbornly opposed it. The people of these kings and the people said that <br />
the people of these princely states are very different from the people of Punjab in terms of language, culture and <br />
social behavior. The same thing was written in response to the letters of Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru and Sardar <br />
Vallabhbhai Patel, the Governor of Punjab, Chandu Lal Trivedi and Gopichand Bhargava. Therefore, the King <br />
of the hill states of Shimla gathered in Delhi in the first week of January, 1948 and made a further program. <br />
In the meeting, these kings passedÂ· this resolution: "After taking complete consideration, It has been decided <br />
that in keeping with the spirit of the people and goodness, all the hill states ofShimla should be organized as a <br />
union." '. Therefore, messages were sent to all the-states that they would choose their respective representatives <br />
and send Solan on January 26, 1948 so that they can participate in the meeting of the committee that constitutes <br />
the constitution. During this period, King Durga Singh of Baghat and King Joginder Sen of Mandi were in <br />
Delhi. Both of them met Mahatma Gandhi there. Gandhiji advised them to convene a meeting of the people and <br />
the representatives of the kings and make a decision about their future. <br />
