## Early History of Himachal Pradesh: Janapadas
According to Mahabharata, the Himalayas region now forming Himachal Pradesh was divided into a number of small tribal republics known as Janapadas 
	which was a type of Sangha Janapadas also called as Ayudhajivi Sanghas, meaning those who lived by the profession of arms. 
	The following are the Janapadas mentioned in Mahabharata and also known to Panini.

* The territory of Audumbaras was located on a very advantageous trade route running from Takshila to the Gangetic valley; Pathankot being the junction of the commercial route.
* Audumbaras had a republican system with an elected king and in the later stage monarchial system of government prevailed.
* Their coins have been found in Kangra, Jawalamukhi, Pathankot, Gurdaspur and Hoshiarpur regions.
* Their coins were inscribed in Brahmi and Kharosthi made up of copper and silver.
* Their coin had the word ‘Mahadeva’ along with the name of Raja of the tribe.

* Kunindas were the hill people who lived in the area lying between the rivers [[River Bea]], Yamuna and Satluj i.e. Shimla and Sirmaur hills and between Ambala and Saharanpur in the plains.
* Kunindas are identified with Kanets in modern times.
* Their coins have been found between Ambala and Saharanpur and on Shivalik Hills.

	* They issued silver and copper coins bearing legends in Prakrit.
	* Silver coins bear the Prakrit script on one side and Kharosthi on the other side used beyond the territorial boundaries.
	* Copper coins had legends in Brahmi script used for local purposes which means copper coins were more prevalent than silver coins.

## Mauryan-Alexander and Himachal
- Alexander’s Invasion: 
	- In 326 B.C. Alexander advanced as far as the river Beas and was opposed by republican people mentioned by Panini as Ayudhajivi Sanghas. His military commander was ‘Coenus’. To mark his advance, Alexander constructed 12 towers at the bank of river [[River Bea]] which have now disappeared.
- Mauryans: 
	- A Himalayan chief Parvataka, who ruled over the territory between the Ravi and Yamuna, helped Chandragupta Maurya in a battle against Alexander’s governor. According to Mudrarakshaka of Vishakhadutta, 
	- Kiratas, Kunindas, and Khasas tribes joined the Guptas army and helped them to defeat the Nandas. Kuluta’s ruler Chitravarman along with 5 other rulers opposed the advance of Chandragupta Maurya towards the hill states.
