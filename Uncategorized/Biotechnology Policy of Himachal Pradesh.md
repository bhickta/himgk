BIOTECHNOLOGY POLICY OF HIMACHAL PRADESH, 2014

- Biotechnology is a fast developing field covering the entire spectrum of human life. Biotechnology is formally defined as “the application of science and technology to living organisms as well as parts, products and models thereof, to alter living or non-living materials for the production of knowledge, goods and services. It involves manipulating and modifying organisms, often at the molecular level, to create new and practical applications for agriculture, medicine and industry.”

Policy mission:  
To convert Himachal Pradesh into a prosperous Himalayan Biobusiness Hub with Biotechnology as one of the engines of growth through scientific and technological empowerment of human resource for enhancing efficiency, productivity, cost effective products, processes and technologies.  
  
Objectives:  
• To make Himachal a preferred and globally competitive destination for development of BT products, processes and services  
. • To upgrade infrastructural support to R&D and Educational Institutions to generate highly skilled human resource in biotechnology.  
• To intensify R&D work in potential areas of biotechnology, including agriculture, animal husbandry, human health, environment and industry.  
• To conserve and commercially exploit bio-resources of the State for sustainable development.  
• To create awareness about the investment opportunities in biotechnology, genomics, bioinformatics, biofuels, contract research, etc. to entrepreneurial community and promote Biotechnology industrial investment in the State.  
• To provide suitable Institutional framework to achieve the objectives.

Institutional Framework:  
• The Department of Environment, Science& Technology will be the Nodal Department in the State that will deal with matters concerning biotechnology in the State..

• Link the policy with the existing policies of the line Departments such as Organic Farming Policy of Agriculture Department; Technical Education Policy of Technical Education Department to modify course curricula in Biotechnology Sector, etc.  
Support R&D Institutions/Universities by providing funds through national and international funding.  
• Execute and monitor commercial exploitation of biotechnological tools.  
• Establish liaison among R&D Institutions/Universities, Industry, farming community and NGOs.  
• Help in establishing ‘Biotechnology Parks’ for promoting biotechnology based industry and R&D Centers in the State.  
• Help in managing intellectual property and patenting issues related to Biotechnology.

Biotechnology Parks :  
The State is already in the process of setting up a Biotechnology Park at Aduwal, Teh. Nalagarh, Dist. Solan. It is proposed to setup Biotechnology Parks/ BT Industrial Cluster in Himachal Pradesh in association with the private sector to boost biotechnology based ventures. Biotechnology based and other auxiliary industries will be located in these Parks. It is proposed to locate these Parks on the Solan and Sirmour districts. The Biotechnology Park will have the following salient features:  
• Biotechnology Incubation Centre (BTIC)  
• Industrial Plots for starter companies  
• Auction/Procurement Centre for raw material of medicinal and aromatic plants and horticultural produce.  
• Auction/Procurement Centre for biotechnology based products.  
• Availability of genetically improved planting material.• Facility for on-line trading.  
• Cold storage facility for perishable products, like flowers  
• Information Technology cell.• Consultancy for biotechnology based industries.  
• Demonstration plots.
