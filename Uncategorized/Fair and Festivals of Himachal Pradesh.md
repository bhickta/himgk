#### Origin
 There is a legend that many centuries ago, Ravi was flowing through the Chamba town where presently Chaugan is situated.
  There is a temple of Champawati on the right side of the river and that of Hari Rai on the other side.
  A Mahatma who was staying by Champawati temple used to visit Hari Rai temple by swimming the river.
  Raja Sahil Varman and people of Chamba town requested the Mahatma to make some arrangement so that all could visit the sacred temple of Hari Rai.
  The Mahatma asked the people to come to the temple of Champawati where a Yajna was performed with the help of Brahmins for seven days.
  A cord of seven different colours was prepared and it was given the name of Minjar.
  On completion of the Yajna, the river changed its course.
  The king thus declared the day to be celeberated as the Minjar day and since then Minjar Fair is held every year at Chamba to commemorate this divine event.
 According to another legend, the fair is held for worship of Varuna, the God of waters
 For good harvest of Maize

### Sui Fair of Chamba

 Sui fair is as old as the time when Chamba became the capital of the princely state.
 For the capital there was no proper supply of water.
 Raja Sahil Varman had made a water source from Sarota stream round the Shah*Madar hill but the water did not enter the channel and it was ascribed to 9 super natural causes.
 The Brahmins who were consulted pronounced that water would pass if the Rani or her son was sacrificed.
 There is another tradition that the Raja had a dream in which he was directed to offer his son as sacrifice.
 But the Rani insisted to sacrifice her own life.
 A grave was dug near Balota village and she was buried alive.
 When the grave was filled up water began to flow and has been flowing ever since.
 The Rani is venerated for her sacrifice and is worshipped as ‘Sui Mata ‘ The fair is held on the last three days of April every year.
 Last day of the fair is known as Sukrat i.e. ‘Sukh*khi*Raat’.
 On the evening of the closing day, Sukrat is sung.
 The fair is colourful and its charm is enhanced by the songs sung not only at the fair but in all the houses of the local residents.

### Mani Mahesh Fair

 Mani Mahesh is situated about 35 kms. from Brahmaur.
 Lord Shiva is believed to reside there.
 Shiva had granted a boon to Brahmini Devi that every pilgrim must worship her before proceeding to Mani Mahesh.
 The oracles of Keling and Mani Mahesh are consulted as to whether their pilgrimage would be successful and accepted by Shiva.
 Pilgrims collect at Brahmaur and start for the yatra.
 They reach Mani Mahesh lake after covering the distance in two stages.
 The pilgrims have to be at the lake on the morning of Radha Ashtami which falls 15 days after Krishna Janam Ashtami in the month of August/September.
 Every devotee must take a dip into lake in the early hours of the morning which is considered as sacred.
 A dip in the lake is taken only after taking a dip first in Gauri Kund which is situated at one km. before Mani Mahesh lake.
 In the past only women used to take a dip in this kund but now all avail this.
 Besides this, two dips in the spring at Hudsar and Dhanchhoh are also essential.
 The pilgrimage to Mani Mahesh is considered as sacred.
 Some of the pilgrims go bare footed.
