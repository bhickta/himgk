* Internet and mobile networks

### Unfair Practices and Unhealthy competition
* Middle man
 * The tourist season has expanded but the stay time of tourists is shrinking. 
 * Porters, taxi operators and guides are ruling the roost. 
* Online operators 
 * offering huge discounts and unregistered home stay accommodation and the bread and breakfast scheme
 * Zostel 
 * 60*70% Discounts 
* Unregistered accommodation :
  * The mushrooming illegal accommodation

 * the existing tourism units are struggling for survival, as their occupancy rate and profits are declining while the operating cost is rising. 
 * Floors registered in names of family members :
 * It is intriguing that 90 per cent of the units being run under the bread and breakfast scheme have 6 rooms, which is the maximum limit, but in numerous cases different floors have been registered as 
### Investment

### Monsoon fury :
* Frequent landslides due to road*widening projects have spelt doom for the tourism industry, especially during the monsoon season from July to September. 
* During this period, the tourism industry mainly depends on foreign tourists, who visit tribal and other high altitude areas for trekking 
* Need transit haults

### Climate change
* Climate change has also taken a toll on ice skating at Asia’s oldest natural ice*skating rink at Shimla
* The lowest number of six skating sessions was witnessed in 2017 against 50 to 100 sessions on an average. The maximum 118 sessions were held during 1997*98.
#### Adventure tourism hit :
