# Traditional water sources of Himachal Pradesh
As there is an imbalance between the supply and consumption of water, particularly by the poor and weaker sections of the society, the traditional sources of water play a significant role. These include springs, Khuls, Baories, Ponds, Khaties and ditches particularly in Himachal Pradesh. These systems supplement the water requirements of the rural and urban areas. There are 10512 traditional sources of water in the state for rural habitations.
