The tradition of woodcarving goes back to 7th and 8th centuries AD. The temples of Lakshana Devi in Bharmaur and Shakti Devi in Chattrari are embellished with highly intricate woodwork done in a classical manner of the post Gupta period. Deodar wood is chiefly employed for wooden architecture of the temples as well as local houses. Later wooden temples of seventeenth century are also decorated with figurative kind of work, displaying the strong influences of the Chamba School of painting. Some devil masks are also preserved in Chamba museum which were used in dance in temple complex of Chattrari. There are several temples in Chamba town that are famous for their exquisite wooden relieves depicting the themes of Hindu mythology and folklore. 

Painting :

The activity of painting in Chamba continued in to the nineteenth century and Sikh influence in the colours, facial features and dresses of the figure can be seen in the paintings executed in the last quarter of 18th century. Bangdwari is one such traditional painting work, which is done on the either sides of a door during wedding ceremony in Chamba. Several figures of Hindu Gods and Goddess together with Lord Ganesha at top are still painted in this ritual painting. 

Basket Making :

Basket manufacturing is intimately connected with daily life of all Pahari people. It is one of the most widely practiced craft in Chamba also. Various functional objects like sturdy bowls, trays and baskets of different shapes and sizes with graceful handles are being manufactured here. The large conical basket known as kilta or kultu in common parlance, is required by all farmers for carrying heavy loads. Baskets are also used for storing food grains and other household articles. Besides these, fans, pinjras (cage) and chhatroru (umbrella) are also made. Basket*making craft is mainly done by the traditional professionals. They work on bamboo grass or seed willow branches. The grass used in Chamba for the purpose is known as 'niru' which is short, fine dull, green and growing abundantly in Bharmaur and Chamba. Attractive cushions are also prepared with this grass. 

Pottery :

Pottery is another very popular craft of Chamba District. Pots of different kinds and sizes are made out of clay. The clay is abundantly available in Chamba as elsewhere in the state. Toys of different types for entertainment and earthen lamps for lighting purpose are also being made. Some of these pots bear different kinds of paintings, motifs, decorations and floral designs. Weaving in Chamba like in other hilly districts is one of the most important craft which evolved into an extremely fascinating craft. Chamba is famous for hand made chappals. The striking feature of Chamba chappal is the embroidery done on them. The embroidery is done with silk and golden threads. Leather embroidered belts are also commonly worn by the local people. These are some of the prominent crafts of Chamba District. 


Clay Crafts of Himachal Pradesh :

Clay Crafts of Himachal Pradesh mirror an amalgamation of culture and skilled craftsmanship. Clay craft centres of Himachal Pradesh are basically located in the areas like Kangra, Mandi, Kulu, Chamba, and Shimla where the communities of many migrated potters reside for decades. In Himachal Pradesh potters enjoy a relatively higher standard of living. This is because there is still a demand for earthenware vessels and there is a strong tradition of using clay figures and vessels for ritual occasions. The area of Himachal Pradesh is still rich in folklore and legends involving the potter, his wheel and his pots. 

The potters, involved in the clay craft of Himachal Pradesh, are known as 'kumhars' by the local people. The artisans are adept at creating clay items like pots, toys, money banks, pitchers, bowls, platters, cups, and lamps, flower vases of different shapes and sizes that are praised among the local people. These items are decorated with white patterns drawn with Golu clay. Apart from these, there are some items which are hugely used for storage purpose. The clay wares of Himachal Pradesh are found in its various forms like gidya, patri and narele etc. The figurines of Hindu gods and goddesses are made and painted in the most beautiful shades along with many accessories. These idols of various gods and goddesses are worshipped in various festivals of Himachal Pradesh. 

The centre of clay craft of Himachal Pradesh is located in Kangra where the potters make clay items using black and dark red colours. The products made are mainly for domestic use and one of the famous items of this region is the container which is used for setting curds. 

The beauty of mud architecture is visible everywhere in Himachal Pradesh, with vertical and horizontal planes merging together organically. Mud stairs and cupboards grow out of floors and walls inside, and outside continue to flow into courtyards. The clay crafts of the state reflect the contours and colours of the surrounding landscape and a result a complete visual harmony is achieved. Hand*cut grey slate tiles cover the roofs, also acting as drying surfaces for the buffalo dung cakes which can be seen in neat lines and rows everywhere, implanted with the finger marks of the woman who patted them into shape. 

The domestic vessels of Himachal Pradesh are exquisitely decorated and are of the finest quality. The potters of the state are greatly talented but in the present age the new generation is moving away from pottery to a number of other lucrative occasions. 

Work of pottery in Himachal Pradesh is seasonal and stops in the winter months of mid*November to January and during summer from mid*May to July. The clay that is used for pottery in Himachal Pradesh is both red as well as yellow clay. The clay is collected twice a year. 

The various types of pots which are prepared in Himachal Pradesh are Gharra for containing water, Muggi for carrying water to the fields, Gharau for boiling milk * different sizes, Dhunnu for boiling milk, Tudhunu for boiling milk and buttermilk, Muggru to carry milk for sale, Kawradu and Dhialu for yoghurt, Girriya for ghee, Parru small container for general use, Katori for vegetables, Girya for pickles and ghee, Kanatu for water drained from rice then given to the animals Handi for cooking, Kangri charcoal burning heater used in the winter Hooka and Chillum for tobacco smoking Goluk money box Auli ritual pot for marriage, plus other ritual pots for death and birth. 

The art of pottery is held in high esteem in the state of Himachal Pradesh. This is very evident from the fact that on the day of Diwali (festival of lights) the wheel of the potter is decorated with a paste made from rice flour. Then a puja is performed with offerings of flowers, incense, rice and sweets. 

In Himachal Pradesh still the practice of Jajmani exists. In this system potters are bound to exchange with the landowners vessels for grain. Pots made by the potters are sold in the melas. Potters in this area also work around the religious festivals when there is a demand to replace water and cooking vessels and for ceremonial clay objects. For example, clay oil lamps are bought at Diwali in November; at Holi water pots are replaced, and on Shankranti, just before the wheat harvest in April, large pots are bought by the farmers in order to offer water to their dead ancestors. 

Finally it can be concluded saying that following the rustic nature of the state, the clay wares created by the artisans have got the typical nature of Himachal Pradesh. 

Slow Vanishing of Himachali Costumes :

Himachal has not really been touched by any external customs but the western influence has surely vanished the popularity of traditional dresses. With the passage of time there has been a constant change in the clothing styles of the present and the older generations. Himachali attires from the past speak volumes about the impressive weaving talents of its craftsmen but the influence of the western culture and new trends has taken over the traditional dresses.

Himachali culture is deep rooted in everyday lives of people and the colors and designs imprinted in the traditional costumes are majorly influenced by its surrounding nature. The traditional costumes included garments like kurti, long coats, caps, shawls, rejta, patti, dathu, gaghri, pyjama, loi and pashmina shawls and the colors and patterns used on them differed in each community and region because of their diverse in customs and traditions.

â€œThe most unique identity of these outfits was that they were hand woven and were crafted with smooth texture and extra finish. These traditional dresses use to be hand made or hand painted in the past but now these are either machine printed or machine embroidered. There are not too many buyers for these traditional dresses as our traditional clothing is changing hands with the modern outfits. We are slowly drifting away from our own culture and often feel ashamed using our traditional things. Moreover nobody can really define whether the influence of western culture is a boon or curse as no culture is good or bad but we just see it as a part of that particular era. Decorative, intricate geometrical and bold designs of Himachali costume was something that has always been in fashion and were equally popular with people living in urban and rural areas. Even today dresses like lengha and stoles are widely known as the fashion symbols as they bear a daily wear of the local Himachali women. Earlier women preferred to stick to a simple salwaar kameez with waistcoat and headscarf but the tradition seems to have faded off as now everyone wants to put on expensive and fascinating clothes of the latest color and design.

â€œThe youngsters love to spend money on their clothes and accessories just for the sake of variety. Fashion in todayâ€™s time is just not a monopoly of women but even men have great fancy for it as they love adopting the latest trend of speech and fashion thereby forgetting the importance of our culture and rich heritage of our tradition. The culture of Himachal is very unique and people from down the ages have been practicing to preserve their own tradition, ethnicity and spirit. Traditionally during earlier days a bride would wear Nath (nose ring), Kach (necklace), Kangan (traditional bangle), Gokhru and Bragar (ear rings) or hand made Gaghri (ankle length skirt) as her wedding dress given to her from grandmother or mother, which normally represented a link between her and her family. Although wearing traditional jewelry on the wedding day has strong roots across all the cultures and has been an integral part of the Himachali lifestyle but today a bride wants to wear a dress or an ornament which is lighter and more practical.

However human cultures and tradition, which forms an essential part of our past, is subject to change but it is really important to preserve and protect it in order to ensure a continuous work for our weavers and people of future generations to enjoy.
