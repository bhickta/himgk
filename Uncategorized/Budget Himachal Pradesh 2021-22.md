* Governance and Administrative Reforms
Grihini Suvidha Yojana
21.	Our Government is committed to ensure transparency in Governance and also more efficient service delivery in the State. I propose the following during 2021-22 to make administration more effective:-
* To improve Governance and to promote healthy competition among the Deputy Commissioners, ‘Swarn Jayanti Innovation Fund’ will be established.
* To increase transparency in public life, it would be mandatory to upload online Annual Assets & Liabilities Statement for Class I & II officers.
* All departments will review and make necessary amendments in their respective Rules, Acts and processes to improve the Ease of Doing Business and Ease of Living for citizens.
* Training of officers and employees in all departments will be made more effective.
22.	Our Government gives top most priority to the dignity of women and is implementing several schemes to realise this objective. Grihani Suvidha Yojana is an important initiative in this connection. It has freed the homemakers from disease, pollution and avoidable drudgery.
23.	Under the ‘Himachal Grihani Suvidha Yojana’, over 2 lakh and 92 thousand families have been provided gas connection. New eligible families will also be provided gas connection under the scheme and free cylinder refill will continue to be given. Our Government will spend Rs.20 crore on this scheme in the next year. Swami Vivekananda had said, “There is no chance for welfare of the world unless the condition of woman is improved. It is not possible for a bird to fly on only one wing.”
24.	Considering the importance of social distancing, Food and Civil Supplies Department will explore the possibility
of introducing IRIS scanning as a method of Biometric identification to improve the processes involved in ration distribution.
25.	Despite COVID, the hard working farmers of the State have supported the State’s economy by toiling in their fields. Agriculture is the foundation of life. Our government expresses gratitude towards the farmers. The various schemes being implemented for farmer welfare are in deference to their role in nation building and their contribution to the national economy.
26.	Considering the success of the first phase of the Japanese Government assisted JICA project in 5 districts of the State, the 2nd phase of the project will be implemented in all 12 districts of the State. This project will be implemented with a total cost of Rs.1,055 crore for which formalities are being finalized. With the objectives of diversification of crops and increasing farmers income, all preparatory activities including finalization of 60 DPRs, capacity building farmers associated with Krishak Vikas Sanghs, modernization of Mandis etc. will be started in 2021-22.
27.	‘Subhash Palekar Natural Farming System’ being implemented under ‘Prakritik Kheti Khushhaal Kissan Scheme’ has been running successfully and has given encouraging results. 1,05,218 farmers have adopted this scheme. 50,000 more farmers would be brought under this scheme in 2021-22. In addition, 1,00,000 farmer families will be made aware about the benefits of natural farming. To create market niche for organic produce, it is proposed to register and certify farmers engaged in this practice and their produce will be branded. I propose a budget of Rs.20 crore for this scheme in 2021-22.
28.	Our Government will start “Swaran Jayanti Paramparagat Beej Suraksha Samvardhan Yojana” to conserve and propagate traditional seeds in the State. Strategy will be chalked out to link propagation of seeds of

Agriculture  and
Irrigation
local pahari pulses, traditional grains and off-season vegetables with the market. Self Help Groups, Farmers and Producer Organizations and Krishak Vikas Sanghs will be included in the scheme.
29.	Speaker Sir, to encourage research and keeping in view the spirit of 6th pillar of the Union Budget 2021-22, which is ‘Innovation and Research & Development’, I announce creation of a “Research and Development Fund” for the Agriculture and Horticulture Universities of the State. This fund will be established with an initial corpus of Rs.5 crore. Detailed guidelines for the same will be issued separately.
30.	63 Mandis are presently operational to assist farmers and producers in selling their produce in the market. The work on 3 new Mandis – Mehndali and Shilaroo (Shimla), Bandrol (Kullu) and expansion and up-gradation of 20 existing Mandis would be completed in 2021-22. For this purpose, Rs.200 crore would be spent. Apart from the existing 19 Mandis, 10 additional Mandis will be linked to ‘E-NAM System’. Presently, Floriculturists are not able to sell their produce in Krishi Mandi of the State because of absence of any provisions in the related Act. I announce that marketing and trading of flowers will be made a permissible activity in these Mandis, by making appropriate addition in the Schedule of HP Agricultural, Horticultural Produce Marketing (Development and Regulation) Act, 2005.
31.	Speaker Sir, to effectively utilise and harness the Culturable Command Area (CCA) already created, the HIMCAD Scheme has been started by the Government. 15,242 hectares of CCA have already been brought under the Command Area Development Scheme. In 2021-22, 4,000 hectare of additional land is proposed to be brought under the scheme at a cost of Rs.83 crore, which is double of the earlier budget provision.
32.	Our Government considers Horticulture as an area of prime importance. The State has achieved several milestones in horticulture sector in the last 50 years due to the hard work of farmers and horticulturists.
33.	Under the Rs.1,000 crore World Bank-funded Horticulture Development Project, following initiatives will be taken in 2021-22, besides other activities:-
* Five lakh root stocks will be imported.
* 8 thousand hectares command area will be provided minor irrigation facilities through 200 Water Users Associations.
* A Gene Repository would be established in Dr. Y.S. Parmar University, Nauni.
* The work of CA stores and Pack Houses at Jarol- Tikker, Rohru, Oddi, Patlikuhl and Tutupani will be completed.
* An Apple Juice Concentrate Plant will be established in the plant at Parala, Shimla.
34.	Implementation of a pilot project at a cost of 10 million US dollars being implemented to boost horticulture farming in Sub Tropical Areas of the State will be fast tracked.
35.	I announce a new scheme “Swarn Jayanti Smridh Bagwan” to provide high density good quality plants to the farmers at affordable cost.
36.	Under the Krishi Utpad Sarankshan (Anti Hail net) Yojana (KUSHY), agriculture and horticulture farmers will continue to get subsidy on hail net. This scheme is quite popular. I would like to apprise the House that the outlay for this scheme was just Rs. 2.27 crore in 2017-18. The scope of this scheme has been expanded immensely by our Government during last three years. I propose to continue this scheme in 2021-22 with an outlay of Rs.60 crore which

Horticulture
Animal Husbandry/ Cow Protection
Fisheries
is enhancement of more than 10 crore over the previous outlay.
37.	I announce the setting up of the State Bee Board to encourage beekeeping activities and to ensure appropriate price to farmers for their produce.
38.	Green houses will be developed on 1 lakh square metres area at a cost of Rs.11 crore in 2021-22 under Himachal Pushap Kranti Yojana to boost floriculture.
Rs. 543 crore have been earmarked for Horticulture Sector in 2021-22.
39.	Speaker Sir, to provide specialised high quality services to dairy farmers, 3 zonal hospitals and 10 veterinary polyclinics will be modernised and provided with modern equipment and tools. The veterinary institutions at sub- division level will also be equipped in a phased manner. An outlay of Rs. 5 crore is proposed for this purpose in 2021-22.
40.	Our Government is dedicated to Gau-seva. It has been providing per Gau-vansh assistance through cow sanctuary and Gau-Sadans in the State. Availability of adequate fodder has to be ensured to serve Gau-vansh. Sheep breeding centres of Taal and Jeori and at cow breeding Centres at Palampur and Bagthan will be developed as Fodder Production Centres.
41.	Speakers Sir, I am happy to announce increase in milk procurement price by Rs. 2 for dairy farmers. During 2021-22 an outlay of Rs. 28 crore is proposed for MILKFED.
42.	Speaker Sir, modern fish markets and allied infrastructure will be developed for fishermen engaged in Gobind Sagar and Pong reservoirs, on the line of agriculture markets. It will help in better marketing of fish and will provide better returns to fish farmers.
43.	One ornamental fish unit each will be set up in Shimla and Kangra in the private sector. One Bio flock Fish Farming
unit will come up in Kangra district. 100 new Trout units will also be established.
44.	Speaker Sir, Hon’ble Prime Minister has emphasized promotion of Climate Change Resilient Agriculture. Even today 90 percent families of the State are directly or indirectly connected to Agricultural and allied activities. Farmer family at the village level is a single unit that engages in agriculture, horticulture, animal husbandry, floriculture, bee keeping, fisheries and other allied activities. Various departments try to reach this same integrated unit through their respective schemes.
45.	It has been observed that at times there is duplication in schemes which does not allow optimum utilisation of time, money and effort. I propose to rationalize and restructure existing schemes being run by different departments in agriculture and allied sectors by keeping interest of farmers at the centre stage. I propose to constitute an Expert Group to prepare an ambitious action plan. This Expert Group will also give recommendations to make efforts for doubling farmers income more effective.
Speaker Sir, I come from a farming family and understand the pain of farmer.
46.	Speaker Sir, recently the elections to Panchayati Raj and Urban Local Bodies have been concluded peacefully and successfully in the State. People have participated in these elections with great enthusiasm and I am happy that they have wholeheartedly supported the policies of our government.  I express my gratitude to people of the State. I also congratulate the newly elected representatives of the rural and urban local bodies. 102 Gram Panchayats have returned their representatives unopposed, without casting a single vote. All such Panchayats are eligible for getting an incentive grant of Rs.10 lakh each.
47.	New Gram Panchayats were last constituted in 2005 although there had been a consistent demand to create new

Agriculture and  Allied Sectors
Panchayati Raj & Rural Development
Panchayats to meet the geographical and administrative needs. 412 new Panchayats have been recently. Currently, there are 3,615 Gram Panchayats in the State.
48.	I announce that all the newly notified Gram Panchayat will be provided with Panchayat Ghars in a phased manner.
49.	Rs. 248 crore will be provided to the Panchayati Raj Institutions in 2021-22 as per the recommendations of 5th State Finance Commission. In addition Rs. 409 crore provided by the Central Government will be spent for rural development programmes through these institutions.
50.	District Resource Centres have been constructed in five districts namely Kangra, Hamirpur, Solan, Mandi and Bilaspur to train representatives of Panchayati Raj Institutions,. Three centres are under construction is Kinnaur, Sirmour and Shimla. In 2021-22 work on District Resource Centres will be started in Una and Kullu.
51.	598 Common Service Centres are being set up in the Panchayats to provide all IT related services at panchayat level under one roof. 2982 Common Service Centres will be established in 2021-22 at a cost of Rs.149 crore.
52.	In 2020-21, 364 sites have been identified and work has been started at 180 places under the ‘Panchwati Scheme’. In 2021-22, parks will be constructed at 100 additional sites under this scheme.
53.	Self Help Groups (SHGs) are a useful tool to empower rural women. Presently over one lakh SHGs have been formed by different departments in the state.
54.	I announce that 5 thousand 500 Self Help Groups will be provided Rs.8 crore 25 lakh as Revolving Fund and 1,500 SHGs will be provided Rs.7 crore 50 lakh as Community Investment Fund under ‘National Rural Livelihood Mission’.
55.	There is a need to provide well-thought and well- planned support to develop entrepreneurship amongst the SHGs. At present the SHGs can avail interest subvention based loan up to an amount of Rs.3,00,000. I propose that the SHGs willing to take a loan up to Rs.5,00,000 to increase their activities and develop their entrepreneurship will be provided interest subvention on same rates for additional amount of Rs.2,00,000. Rs.10 crore will be spent annually on this subsidy.
56.	Self Help Groups need a range of specialist support services to improve their functioning and to take their products to the market. Best 100 SHGs will be provided performance based incentive to meet these objectives. Detailed guidelines will be issued in this regard at an early date. I announce to bring both these initiatives of my Government under a new ‘Swaran Jayanti SHG Sahyog Yojana’.
57.	I announce to launch a new scheme “HIM IRA Rasoi (Canteen)” on pilot basis under which SHGs will run canteens in Technical Education Institutions and government offices to provide additional livelihood opportunities for Self Help Groups.

62.	In the last budget, I had affirmed Government’s resolve to increase the tree cover percentage from 27.72 percent to 30 percent by 2030. A new policy will be formulated with provisions for both incentives and disincentives to increase survival percentage of new plantations and to ensure accountability. New plantation on 12,000 hectare land was targeted in 2020-21. I propose to enhance this target and new plantation will be done on 14,000 hectare land in 2021-22.
63.	On the occasion of the 50th anniversary of Statehood our Government will develop 68 Swarnim Vatikas to promote healthy and natural life styles among citizen.

Presently, 3 Externally Aided Projects are being implemented in the State namely Forest Ecosystem Climate Proofing Project of KfW; JICA assisted Improvement of Himachal Pradesh Forest Ecosystem and Livelihood; and World Bank assisted IDP for Source Sustainability and Climate Resilient Rain-Fed Agriculture. Under these projects, 2000 hectare of land infested with lantana will be treated, plantations will be raised on 3,000 hectare area and 7,000 hectare area will be treated under soil conservation and management works.

67.	Speaker Sir, recently we have simplified the procedures for obtaining permission for felling trees on private land. This will help increasing farmers’ incomes. Divisional Forest Officers/ Conservators have been delegated enhanced powers to give tree-felling permissions.

71.	Speaker Sir, Himachal Pradesh welcomes the ‘National Education Policy-2020’. This policy will bring comprehensive and far reaching changes in the field of

Environment, Science and Technology
Quality Education
education right from early childhood care to higher education. Credit goes to the Hon’ble Prime Minister who has dedicated National Education Policy-2020 to the nation to realise the resolve of Atmanirbhar Bharat.
The determining principle of the National Education Policy-2020 is :
“The purpose of the education system is to develop good human beings capable of rational thought and action, possessing compassion and empathy, courage and resilience, scientific temper and creative imagination, with sound ethical moorings and values.”
72.	School examination for the students studying in 3rd, 5th and 8th standards will be mandatory for assessment of the Teaching Learning Process as per the National Education Policy-2020.
73.	I had announced “Swaran Jayanti Super-100” scheme in my previous budget which aimed at providing coaching to the meritourious students for admission into professional institutions. I propose to expand the scope of this scheme and start a new Scheme “Top-100 Scholarship Scheme”. Under the scheme, best 100 students from all Government schools will be selected by the SCERT after 5th standard.
74.	I propose to start special courses in Science, Maths and Spoken English on pilot basis to prepare young students for competitive examinations.

76.	Sports play an important role in the overall development of the students. School sports tournaments are organized at Block, District and State level. I propose to double the diet money of the participants from Rs.50 to Rs.100 at Block level, from Rs. 60 to Rs.120 at Zonal and District level and from Rs. 75 to Rs.150 at the State level.
77.	Speaker Sir, our Government started ‘Medha Protsahan Yojna’ in 2018-19 to provide financial assistance to meritorious students who aspired to take coaching for competitive exams outside the State. Till date 838 students have been given monetary help of Rs.2.19 crore. The State Government will continue to promote meritorious students in the State through all possible measures.
78.	Quite after, our talented students very often have to go outside the State to take coaching for competitive exams. During COVID time the education department provided quality education by reaching out to the remotest parts of the State through ‘Har Ghar Pathshala’, the digital platform. Our Government will make a policy using available human resources and technology to coach Government school students for various competitive exams. The policy will also take into account the personality development and career counselling needs of the students. Both online and offline modes will be used for providing coaching to the students. I propose an outlay of Rs. 5 crore for this purpose.
79.	Under the ‘Sriniwas Ramanujam Scheme’, meritorious students are given laptops. Given the technological advances, alternatives to laptops are available. It is proposed to consider suitable modifications to the
Technical Education
existing scheme. Outlay of Rs.25 crore is proposed for this scheme.
80.	Speaker Sir, last year we took the initiative to give new direction in education sector with focus on quality. Specifically, I would like to mention three schemes– Swaran Jayanti Gyanodaya Cluster Srestha Vidyalaya Yojana, Swaran Jayanti Utkrisht Vidyalaya Yojana and Utkrisht Yojana for the Colleges. 100 Cluster Schools, 68 Senior Secondary Schools and 9 Colleges will be covered under these schemes in the coming year. These institutions will be equipped with essential modern facilities and will be adequately staffed. I propose Rs. 63 crore for these three schemes in 2021-22.
81.	Infrastructure up-gradation will be taken up in 100 other schools in convergence with the Rural Development Department.
82.	I announce to enhance the maximum limit of remuneration of all categories of teachers under SMC by Rs. 500 per month. I also announce to raise remuneration of IT teachers deployed on outsourced basis in different schools.I also announce to setup a High Powered Committee under the Chairmanship of Chief Secretary to look into the demands of Teachers of various categories.
83.	Keeping in view the health of school children our government will provide hygiene kits to the Mid Day Meal workers in 2021-22. I am happy to announce that the honorarium of Mid Day Meal Workers and Water Carriers will be enhanced by Rs.300 per month.

An amount of about Rs.400 crore will be spent on these works.
86.	Speaker Sir, our Government is fully committed to the health and well-being of the people of Himachal Pradesh particularly children. Our Government is studying the recent report of National Family Health Survey- 5 in its seriousness. Different departments will have to come together to address the problems of stunting, wasting, malnutrition, and anaemia. I announce that the Government in collaboration with the NITI Aayog conduct a study and prepare an Action Plan based on it to tackle these problems.
87.	As Positron Emission Tomography (PET) Scan facility is not available in any health institution in the State, therefore, cancer patients are compelled to get this facility at exorbitant rates in neighbouring States. I announce that PET scan machine will be installed in IGMC, Shimla during 2021-
22. In addition, CT Scan and MRI machines will be provided in the Medical College Tanda. Hamirpur and Nahan Medical Colleges will be provided MRI machine. I propose an outlay of Rs.70 crore for this.
88.	Speaker Sir, the state Government expresses its gratitude to the Union Government for the apex health institutions such as AIIMS, Bilaspur and PGI Satellite Centre, Una. I announce that the Super Speciality Hospital, Chamiyana, Shimla being built with a total cost of Rs.278 crore will be made functional during 2021-22. In addition, the new OPD Block and Trauma Centre being constructed with a cost of Rs.103 crore and Rs.25 crore respectively at IGMC Shimla will also be made functional in 2021-22. The

Rs.772 crore will be spent to provide adequate services and for infrastructure improvement in the State Medical Colleges located at Shimla, Tanda, Nahan, Hamirpur, Chamba and Nerchowk and also in the Dental College at Shimla. This expenditure has risen by 28 percent from Rs. 554 crore, three years back, when my Government took office.

92.	Dealing with blindness and other vision related ailments among children is a challenge for health policy makers. These children need corrective action at an early age. I announce launching of ‘Mission Drishti’ to cover all Government school students from Class-VI to Class-X. Free eye check-ups will be done and free spectacles, if needed, will be provided to them.
93.	I am extremely happy to announce that the State has emerged as the best performer in Total Immunisation. Mother and Child Health services will be provided in an integrated manner. Digital Haemoglobin Meters will be provided to all the Health Sub-Centres and Rashtriya Bal Swasthya Karyakram teams. These will be helpful in timely identification and addressing the problem of anaemia.
94.	Pneumonia is one of the major reasons of under 5 mortality. Our Government has taken several steps to reduce the deaths on account of pneumonia. In this context I announce that pneumonia screening will be done in all Health and Wellness Centres with the help of Oximeter under the Universal Primary Health Care Programme. The programme will be started in Mandi and Chamba districts in first phase and will be expanded to other districts, based on the results.
95.	Child malnutrition figures are a matter of concern. My government is fully committed to improve this situation. Poshan Punrvaas Kendras will be set up in all the State Medical Colleges to address this problem.
96.	I announce to increase the stipend of PG students, Junior Residents, Senior Residents, DM/M.ch students by Rs.5,000 per month.

In addition, they will be incentivised to take expectant mothers to ‘Pradhan Mantri Surakshit Matritva Abhiyan’ Clinics for third Ante Natal Check-ups. An amount of Rs.2 crore will be spent on this.
98.	State Government will set up 143 AYUSH Wellness Centres in 2021-22. AYUSH Department will train a group of Yoga instructors who will be available to give services in private sector to popularise Yoga.
99.	Everyone knows “Jaan Hai to Jahan Hai”. Here I would like to repeat the following lines spoken daily by billions of Indians representing our cultural tradition:-
Om, May all be happy; May all be free from Illness; May all see what is auspicious; May no one suffer.I propose an outlay of Rs. 3,016 crore for health services.
Cooperation
Urban Development
100.	Our Government will computerise 50 Societies on pilot basis with the assistance of NABARD to strengthen the Primary Agriculture Cooperative Societies in the State. In coming years, the programme will be expanded to include all Primary Agriculture Societies at a cost of Rs.10 crore.
101.	Our Government will help 50 Primary Agriculture Cooperative Societies to convert as Multi Service Centres by providing assistance at concessional 4 percent interest through Cooperative Banks. The programme will be expanded in a phased manner to cover more Primary Agricultural Cooperation Societies (PACS).
102.	Speaker Sir, despite increasing urbanization only 10 percent of our total population lives in notified urban areas. After an interval of 15 years our Government has reorganized urban areas of the State to ensure planned development of fast urbanizing areas. As a result 3 new Municipal Corporations at Mandi, Solan and Palampur; one new Municipal Council at Sarkaghat; and seven new Nagar Panchayats at Shahpur, Amb, Ani, Nirmand, Chirgaon, Nerwa and Kandaghat have been notified.
103.	The newly created ULBs and the newly merged areas have been exempted from paying properly tax for a period of 3 years and the rights of the residents have also been protected. Our Government is committed to strengthen infrastructure in these urban bodies by providing better facilities such as street lights, parks, roads, parking, open gym etc. All the required posts will be filled up in the newly created urban local bodies at the earliest to strengthen these bodies.
104.	I propose to give grant of one crore rupees each to the newly notified Municipal Corporations of Solan, Palampur and Mandi to strengthen the basic infrastructure for the benefit of the people in the newly created urban bodies and merged areas. Grant of Rs. 20 lakh each for the newly notified Nagar Panchayats during 2021-22 will be provided.

two schemes. This will help in making the girl children self reliant.
208.	A woman’s life house changes drastically after marriage. She adopts her husband’s after leaving her parents’ house as is the established social practice.

210.	I am happy to announce that 40,000 additional beneficiaries will be provided social security pension during 2021-22 with an additional expenditure of Rs.60 crore.
211.	Speaker Sir, all civilized societies have a special place and respect for elderly persons. We owe our existence to them and we are highly indebted to them for making us what we are today. It is our duty to support them at this critical juncture of their lives to avoid any hardships to them.
212.	Speaker Sir, I announce a new scheme ‘Swaran Jayanti Naari Sambal Yojana’ from 2021-22 with an objective to expand social security net for elderly women of Himachal Pradesh.

and one should have courage and determination to see that the strong thoughts are brought to practice.

For this, New Colleges, Divisional Offices of Jal Shakti & PWD, Pharmacy College, Development Blocks, Tehsils, Sub- Tehsils, Police Stations, Police Posts, and Fire Stations etc. will be opened. For this, wherever possible existing resources will be used appropriately.
237.	It is important to fill up functional posts in a phased manner despite difficult fiscal situation to ensure quality service delivery to people of the State. I have made a mention of strengthening various departments at different places in my Budget Speech.
238.	Our Government will fill 4,000 (four thousand) posts of different categories in Health Department, 4,000 posts of different category teachers in Education Department; 8,000 posts of Multi Task Part Time Workers in Education Department; 5,000 posts of Multi Task Part Time Workers in PWD and 5,000 posts of Para Fitters, Pump Operators & Multi Task Part Time Workers in Jal Shakti Department.

Our Government has, therefore, kept a target of filling up 30,000 functional posts in 2021-22.
239.	Development of alternative modes of transport is need of the hour in Himachal Pradesh. Civil aviation and railways are two such areas where benefits can be reaped with some extra effort.
240.	Chandigarh- Baddi rail line is important from the view point of the industrial development. The required land acquisition process will be completed along the rail line in 2021-22. The land acquisition process along the last 20 Kilometres on Bhanupalli-Bilaspur rail line will be completed in 2021-22.

Alternative  modes
of  transport

Swaran Jayanti Ashray Yojana
Employees Welfare
244.	Speaker Sir, my Government has taken several positive steps to improve standard of living besides providing basic amenities to the people of the State. In my last year’s budget speech, I had announced ‘Swaran Jayanti Ashraya Yojana’. This was widely appreciated. Due to COVID, implementation of scheme got delayed. Reaffirming the commitment of my Government, I propose to sanction 12 thousand houses with basic amenities during 2021-22. Last year, this number was 10 thousand. Here I would like to say that:-
245.	Re-iterating the resolve expressed during last year’s budget speech, my Government shall ensure the all eligible Scheduled Castes beneficiaries get their own housing unit by the end of 2022. An amount of 180 crore will be spent in 2021-22 for this purpose which is more than the previous year’s outlay by Rs. 20 crore.
246.	Speaker Sir, I propose an outlay of Rs.36 crore to repair and maintain residential accommodation at the district level to meet the long standing demand of officers and officials posted at the district level. I propose an outlay of Rs.115 crore to maintain Government offices and an outlay of Rs.42 crore for maintenance of Government residential buildings.
247.	Speaker Sir, the pay anomaly in respect of some categories of Class IV employees on completing 20 years of service will be removed.
248.	Class-IV employees are eligible to be promoted to the ministerial posts through two channels namely Limited Direct Recruitment and promotion, on turn. I announce that henceforth, they will also be eligible for promotion to the post of Junior Office Assistant (IT).
249.	Keeping in view the pendency of medical reimbursement claims of retired Government servants, I propose to increase the allocation to Rs.100 crore.
250.	I announce to increase minimum daily wage from Rs.275 to Rs. 300 per day. Other daily wagers will also get proportionate increase. The hourly wage rate of Part Time workers will also be enhanced accordingly.
251.	This august House has discussed the matter of exploitation of outsource employees by the service providers on several occasions. I propose to finalise a Model Tender Document and circulate it to all the departments so that a uniform policy is followed and their interests are protected.
252.	I would like to inform the house that in the last 3 years, the per month wages/rates being paid to the daily wagers and outsource employees have been increased by Rs.2700 per month which is more than 42 per cent.
253.	Our Government had issued amended detailed guidelines with regard to appointments on compassionate grounds increasing the income limit and also the age limit for determining eligibility. This policy will be reviewed to see that its benefit reaches the needy members of families.
254.	The National Pension Schemes (NPS) was introduced in the year 2003 but it is my Government, which
in last 3 years, has extended additional benefits. Firstly, in 2019, we increased the Government contribution to the NPS subscribers from 10 percent to 14 percent. This entails additional expenditure of Rs.200 crore every year. Secondly, in 2020, death and retirement gratuity benefits were allowed to NPS employees, retired or died prior to September, 2017, resulting in an additional expenditure of Rs.110 crore. We are sympathetically considering further demands of NPS employees.
255.	My Government is committed to give revised pay scale/pension to employees/pensioners of the state.
Budget Estimates
256.	Speaker Sir, in 51st year of our Statehood, I would like to share interesting information symbolizing the progress of the State. In 1971-72, the budget size of the State was Rs.80.18 crore only. Today I am presenting a budget of Rs. 50,192 crore for the year 2021-22. Speaker Sir, it is a matter of pride for the august House and people of the State that our Government is presenting a budget of more than Rs. 50,000 crore on the completion of 50 years of Statehood of Himachal Pradesh.
257.	Speaker Sir, now I present the revised estimates for 2020-21. As per the revised estimates for 2020-21, total revenue receipts are expected to be Rs. 35,588 crore. Total revenue expenditure as per revised estimates for 2020-21 is expected to be Rs. 36,011 crore. Thus the total revenue deficit is expected to be Rs. 423 crore as per revised estimates.
258.	The total budget of the State for 2021-22 is Rs. 50,192 crore. During 2021-22, total revenue receipts are estimated at Rs. 37,028 crore whereas, total revenue
expenditure is estimated to be Rs. 38,491 crore. Thus total revenue deficit is estimated at Rs. 1,463 crore. Fiscal deficit is estimated to be Rs. 7,789 crore which is 4.52 percent of the Gross State Domestic Product.
259.	Speaker Sir, no new taxes are proposed in the budget estimates for 2021-22. I believe that necessary resources will be mobilized through effective tax administration, funding from international funding agencies, continued support from Government of India and prudence in fiscal management.
260.	Out of every hundred rupees to be spent by the Government in 2021-22, Rs.25.31 will be spent on salaries, Rs.14.11 on pension, Rs.10 on interest payment, Rs.6.64 on loan repayment and Rs.43.94 will be spent on development works and other activities. The detailed budget estimates for the financial year 2021-22 are contained in the budget documents which are being presented to this august House.
261.	The Corona has impacted the revenue receipts adversely during 2020-21. Its impact on State’s own revenue cannot be ruled out during 2021-22. This might come in the way of achieving the targets fixed under FRBM Act. There is a provision for granting relaxations in the conditions of the FRBM Act in the eventuality of a natural calamity. The details of FRBM Act are being presented accordingly.
Speaker Sir, We are guided by the values of welfare of the masses in our commitment towards public welfare, therefore, the Budget is not just an estimate of anticipated income and expenditure for the coming financial year. For us this is a living document to fulfil public
expectations.Social security, health, women welfare, housing for all, farmers welfare, quality education, connectivity (physical and digital both) and employment generation are the focal points of this budget. As always our priority has been welfare of the schedule castes, schedule tribes, economically weaker sections and other needy groups. This budget shall give fillip to economic growth by strengthening initiatives of entrepreneurship and skill development; tourism and basic infrastructure. My government is tirelessly working very hard to meet the expectations of each and every Himachali. Sabka Sath, Sabka Vikas and Sabka Vishwas is our guiding principle.
Speaker Sir, I would like to commend this budget to this august House.
