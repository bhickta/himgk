* This Pahari styles of painting developed in the Sub-Himalayan states that were also under the umbrella of Mughal overlordship. There were many schools that were flourishing in smaller kingdoms, which came under the blanket of ‘Pahari Paintings’. These consisted ateliers in the court of around 22 princely states stretching from Jammu to Almora. Hence, the Pahari paintings can be grouped into two groups:
    - Jammu or Dogra School: Northern Series
    - Kangra School: Southern Series
* The themes that were painted ranged from mythology to literature and brought new techniques to the fore. A typical Pahari painting would bring several figures into the canvas and they would all be full of movement. Each figure is different in composition, colour, and pigmentation. Two of the greatest figures of this school are Nainsukh and Manaku
