# Panchayati Raj System Himachal Pradesh

## Panchayat Intro
* The Panchayat Raj is the oldest system of local government. The word ‘Panchayat‘ is an amalgamation of two words where ‘Panch‘ means ‘five‘ and ‘Ayat‘ means ‘assembly‘ and ‘Raj‘ means ‘rule‘.
* In 1992 a major change in the Panchayat system of India came in the form of the passage of the Panchayati Raj Act (73rd Amendment).
 * The act came into existence with effect from April 24, 1993.  Therefore, April 24 is celebrated as Panchayati Raj Day in India  It was celebrated for the first time in April 2010.
### Problems of Panchayati raj system
* absence of regular elections 
* prolonged supersessions
* insufficient representation of weaker sections
* inadequate devolution of powers
* lack of financial resources.

To overcome the inefficiency of the system many committees were set up since independence like the Balwant Rai Mehta committee in 1957 to study the community development plan and national extension service program and recommended three*tier system.

Similarly, the Santhanam committee in 1963 was set up to look into the revenue, grant, and financial relations at a different level.

One major issue arises in the context with the PRIs was that it got dominated by the privileged section. To look into the matter a committee was set up in 1977 known as Ashok Mehta committee. It recommended the two*tier system instead of the three*tier system, Zila Parishad and Mandal panchayat thus favouring the abolishment of block*level, also recommended taxation in items under Zila Parishad, Nyay Panchayat should be separated from development panchayat and a ministry of Panchayat Raj in every state.

G.V. K. Rao committee was set up on poverty alleviation in 1985.

For the first time, a committee favoured the constitutional status to PRI was the L.M. Singhvi committee.  The Report of L.M. Singhvi Committee on Revitalization of Panchayati Raj Institutions was accepted in 1986 by the then government. The Committee had considered Gram Sabha as the base of decentralized democracy, and PRIs were viewed as institutions of self*governance which would actually facilitate the participation of the people in the process of planning and development.

Decentralization is the key to development in the present scenario. There are many advantages of decentralization such as it brings decision making close to the people, also held the decision*maker accountable for effective implementation of the policy. It ensures the more realistic and practical planning in the given area. Decentralization increases the vigilance towards the money spent thus help in reducing the room of corruption. It helped in increases the participation of almost every strata of society.

We have traveled a long since the 73rd amendment and plugged many loopholes in the system, but still a long way to go. There are still many issues persist which restrict the Panchayati Raj system to work effectively and independently. The first failure is the transfer of various governance functions like health, education sanitation, etc.

In the amendment, there are two lists mandatory and voluntary. Almost all the governance*related functions fall in the voluntary list which means at the discretion of the state government. Thus there is very little devolution of authority and function by the states towards the PRI, the exception being a Kerala state.

The second issue is related to finance. Local governments can either raise their own revenue through local taxes or receive intergovernmental transfers. The 73rd Amendment recognized both forms of public finance (revenue through taxation and transfer through state finance commission), but did not mandate either, means again in the voluntary list. The power to tax, even for subjects falling within the purview of PRIs, has to be specifically authorized by the state legislature. The 73rd Amendment let this be a choice open to the state legislatures a choice that most states have not exercised, again exception being Kerala.

The constitutional amendment created provisions for State Finance Commissions to recommend the revenue share between state and local governments. However, these are merely recommendations and the state governments are not bound by them. Though the Finance Commissions, at every level, have advocated for greater devolution of funds, there has been little action by states to devolve funds. As a result, PRIs are so starved for funds that they are often unable to meet even payroll obligations. They are reluctant to take on projects that require any meaningful financial outlay and are often unable to solve even the most basic local governance needs.

Reservation of women at the Panchayat level was the important feature of the 73rd amendment. It was a crucial step considering the fact that women had low participation in public life. The impact and implications of this policy are mixed. On the one hand, women elected are claimed to be the front for their male relatives. On the other hand, it has been argued that the female representative is indeed proactive and brings about several efficient changes.

_Chavvi  Rajawat, Prajwal Busta, Arti Devi are some such fine examples who have ushered in new positive reforms at the village level._

Panchayats is a State subject, thus the Panchayati Raj system is primarily the responsibility of the States. The onus on strengthening the Panchayati Raj is on State. Effective decentralization is the need of the hour for proactive governance at the village level. One such fine example is the state of Kerala where local bodies have been given a certain amount of autonomy to decide upon the various reforms and policies which could help in effective governance at the local level, e.g. it has a decentralized health system which has helped a lot in tackling the COVID 19.

In Village councils, they have taken upon themselves to enforce and monitor mass quarantine with the consent of the people, thus mainly helped in community outreach, rigorous contact tracing, and mass quarantine. Its Kudamshree programmme related to women empowerment in the various fields helped in strengthening and making it more participatory at the village level.

Panchyati Raj as an institution is vital to foster better local governance and therefore it is necessary that government should focus more on sustainable decentralization and bring in clarity in the assignment of the function of the panchayat, otherwise, it will remain as a tool for implementing the central and state schemes only.

           

Panchyati Raj System in Himachal Pradesh :

Panchayati Raj system in Himachal Pradesh was established in a statutory form under the provisions of the Himachal Pradesh Panchayati Raj Act, 1952 in the year 1954. Only 280 Gram Panchayats existed prior to the enactment of the Himachal Pradesh Panchayat Raj Act, 1952. However, after the enactment of the said Act, 466 Gram Panchayats were established in the year 1954 and the number of Gram Panchayats was increased to 638 during the year 1962. On 1st November, 1966, the hilly areas of Punjab were merged in this State and consequently the number of Gram Panchayats rose to 1695. In the merged area, a three tier Panchayati Raj system was in existence under the provisions of Punjab Panchayat Samiti and Zila Parishad Act, whereas two tier system was prevalent in this State.

With a view to bring uniformity in the Panchayati Raj system of the old and the newly merged areas, the Himachal Pradesh Panchayati Raj Act, 1968 was enacted on 15th November, 1970 in this State and the two tier Panchayati Raj system was established throughout the State. Besides this the Nayaya Panchayats were also in existence in this State for discharging judicial functions, but during the year 1977 the Nayaya Panchayats were abolished and the judicial functions were transferred to the Gram Panchayats. After the enactment of the said Act in the year 1970 the existing Gram Sabhas were reorganised/bifurcated from time to time and new Gram Sabhas/Gram Panchayats were established.

Panchayati Raj setup in the state:

At present there is 12 Zila Parishads, 78 Panchayat Samtitis and 3226 Gram Panchayats in the State.

Constitutional Provisions :

Panchayats have been one of the basic features of the Indian society. As we know even Mahatma Gandhi advocated for panchayats and village republics. Since independence, we had multiple provisions of Panchayats in India from time to time finally reaching epitome with the 73rd Constitutional Amendment Act of 1992.

The Act aims to provide a three-tier system of Panchayati Raj, which consists of:

(a) Village-level Panchayats

(b) Block-level Panchayats

(c) District-level Panchayats

Main Features of the 73rd Amendment Act :

-    Gram Sabha may exercise such powers and perform such functions at the village level as the Legislature of a State may, by law, provide.
-    There shall be constituted in every State, Panchayats at the village, intermediate and district levels in accordance with the provisions of this Part.
-    Panchayats at the intermediate level may not be constituted in a State having a population not exceeding twenty lakhs.
-    All the seats in a Panchayat shall be filled by persons chosen by direct election from territorial constituencies in the Panchayat area and, for this purpose, each Panchayat area shall be divided into territorial constituencies in such manner that the ratio between the population of each constituency and the number of seats allotted to it shall, so far as practicable, be the same throughout the Panchayat area.
-   The Legislature of a State may, by law, provide for the representation of the Chairpersons of the Panchayats at the village level, intermediate level or, in the case of a State not having Panchayats at the intermediate level, in the Panchayats at the district level

The Representation of People Act, 1951 :

Reservation of Seats for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes:

-   Article 243 D provides that seats shall be reserved for the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes. In every Panchayat, the reservation of seats shall be in proportion to their population. Out of the seats so reserved not less than one-third of the total number of seats reserved shall be reserved for women belonging to the Scheduled Castes or the Scheduled Tribes respectively.

A person shall be disqualified for being a member of a Panchayat, if he is so disqualified by or under any law for the time being in force for the purposes of elections to the Legislature of the State concerned; and if he is so disqualified by or under any law made by the Legislature of the State.

Powers, Authority and Responsibilities of Panchayat:

State Legislatures have the legislative powers to confer on Panchayats such powers and authority as may be necessary to enable them to function as institutions of self-government. They may be entrusted with the responsibility of preparing plans and implementation of schemes for economic development and social justice.

Powers to Impose Taxes and Financial Resources : A state may by law authorise a Panchayat to levy, collect and appropriate taxes, duties, tolls, fees etc. It can also assign to a Panchayat various duties, taxes etc. collected by the State Government. The grants-in-aid may be given to the Panchayats from the Consolidated Fund of the State.

Panchayat Finance Commissions:

Within one year from the commencement of the Constitution (73rd Amendment Act, 1992), constitute a Finance Commission, to review the financial position of the Panchayats and to make recommendations to the Governor.

Urban Local Bodies:

In contemporary times, as urbanization has grown and at present, rapidly growing, the necessity of urban governance is inevitable, which too evolved gradually since British times and has taken a modern shape in post-independence times. With the 74th Amendment Act of 1992, the system of urban local governance has been constitutionally recognized.

Main Features of 74th Amendment Act :  

1. There shall be constituted in every State, (a) a Nagar Panchayat (b) a Municipal Council for a smaller urban area; (c) a Municipal Corporation for a larger urban area.  
2. All the seats in a Municipality shall be filled by persons chosen by direct election from the territorial constituencies in the Municipal area known as wards.

4. Constitution of ward committee  
5. Seats shall be reserved for the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes in every Municipality  
6. Not less than one-third of the total number of seats reserved shall be reserved for women belonging to the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes.  
7. A State may, by law, endow the Municipalities with such powers and authority as may be necessary to enable them to function as institutions of self-government  
8. The Legislature of a State may, by law authorise a Municipality to levy, collect and appropriate   such taxes, duties, tolls and fees.  
9. There shall be constituted in every State at the district level a District Planning Committee to consolidate the plans prepared by the Panchayats and the Municipalities in the district and to prepare a draft development plan for the district as a whole.  
10. The Legislature of a State may, by law, make provision with respect to the composition of the Metropolitan Planning Committees;  
Types of Urban Local Bodies :  
1. Municipal Corporation, 2. Municipality, 3. Notified Area Committee, 4. Town Area Committee, 5. Cantonment Board, 6. Township, 7. Port trust, 8. Special purpose agency

So the introduction of the Panchayati Raj system was a good step in conveying the message of the democracy to the every village of the country.
